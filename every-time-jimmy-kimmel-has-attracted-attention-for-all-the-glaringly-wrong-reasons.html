While the writer-actor has been very gracious and forgiving towards Kimmel‚Äôs antics, the internet has not been able to gulp down how unnecessary and annoying it was that the host dragged his ‚Äúbit.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>But this is nothing new for the host as one look at Kimmel‚Äôs history is enough to establish that he has a way of landing himself in the hot seat of controversies.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-when-jimmy-kimmel-mocked-nba-star-karl-malone-with-a-blackface data-injectable=false>When Jimmy Kimmel mocked NBA star Karl Malone with a blackface</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Kimmel‚Äôs time on the highly controversial The Man Show, which ran from 1999 to 2004, remains the most contentious phase of his life. Wrapping insane levels of sexism in layers of satire, the host indulged in everything from groping women to openly objectifying them and whatnot. Though Kimmel has left the stage of the show years ago, his not-so-hilarious jokes haven‚Äôt aged well and still attract biting criticism for the comedian.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>But what actually put him on the radar of the rampant cancel culture was the resurfaced clips of his recurring sketches from the show wherein he tried to imitate NBA legend Karl Malone by wearing blackface. This took place in 2020, right when it was announced that Kimmel would be hosting the Emmy Awards. His taking the summer off at the time only added fuel to the fire, prompting the host to break his silence and extend a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">long overdue apology</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jimmy Kimmel's Karl Malone sketch wasn't merely offensive due to blackface.</p><p>It's the voice / speech patterns.</p><p>Can one of you supercut geniuses like <a href=#>@greg_price11</a> compare Kimmel's impersonation of Malone with how Malone actually speaks?</p><p>Kimmel's act is really gross and racist.</p>‚Äî Cernovich (@Cernovich) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>We get a night full of Jimmy Kimmel lecturing conservatives.</p><p>Yes, this Jimmy Kimmel of Karl Malone blackface fame <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HRa8oN8IQh</a></p>‚Äî Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) <a href=#>March 5, 2018</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kimmel wore blackface and mocked NBA legend Karl Malone as if he were an unintelligent animal.</p><p>Now, after backlash, he's tucking tail and running away.

One such video was an interview with Megan Fox in 2009 on his show Jimmy Kimmel Live! where the actress revealed how director Michael Bay went for an objectified visualization of her when she auditioned to be an extra in his film Bad Boys II at the age of 15.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>He made her ‚Äúdance underneath a waterfall‚Äù in a bikini, which as Fox highlighted, was the ‚Äúmicrocosm of how Bay‚Äôs mind works.‚Äù Kimmel, instead of being sensitive and understanding the gravity of Fox‚Äôs revelation, quipped that what Bay did was ‚Äúreally a microcosm of how all our minds works, but some of us have the decency to repress those thoughts and pretend that they don‚Äôt exist.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>After the video resurfaced, Megan Fox fans thrashed Kimmel on Twitter and demanded that he apologize to the actress.

They were questioned by the comedian to think of ways to pay back the debt of $1.3 trillion dollars America owed to China. One boy pitched the suggestion to ‚Äúshoot cannons all the way over and kill everyone in China,‚Äù which Kimmel called an ‚Äúinteresting idea.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>He then proceeded to pose the question whether ‚Äúwe allow the Chinese to live,‚Äù thus prompting one of the kids to chime in with a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù while others said yes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The segment soon triggered a massive controversy, pushing ABC to publish an apology assuring that they never intended to ‚Äúupset‚Äù any community.
