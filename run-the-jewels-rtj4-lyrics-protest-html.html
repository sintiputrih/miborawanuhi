The track <a href=#>“Early,”</a> which imagines member Killer Mike being killed by a police officer during a traffic stop, felt all too relevant after its release — not to mention a month later, when a grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown. Over half a decade later, nothing has changed, as Run the Jewels release their fourth album with <a href=#>people across the country and around the world protesting</a> the recent police <a href=#>killings of George Floyd</a>, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, David McAtee, and countless others.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckazqqkhn001g3h67a5ax6un3@published data-word-count=77>The duo of Killer Mike and El-P address police brutality, racism, corruption, and protest head-on on this album, which <a href=#>El-P described to Vulture as</a> “a completely relentless, savage fucking punch in the face.” After <a href=#>pushing the album up from June 5 to Wednesday, June 3</a>, Run the Jewels wrote to fans, “The world is infested with bullshit so here’s something raw to listen to while you deal with it all.” These seven lyrics feel particularly apt today.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckazm4ol8002d3h67s9jhg9z9@published>“yankee and the brave (ep. 4)”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckazm4sfl002s3h67arfpb3wp@published data-word-count=61><strong>“I got one round left, a hunnid cops outside</strong><br><strong>I could shoot at them or put one between my eyes</strong><br><strong>Chose the latter, it don’t matter, it ain’t suicide</strong><br><strong>And if the news say it was that’s a goddamn lie</strong><br><strong>I can’t let the pigs kill me, I got too much pride</strong><br><strong>And I meant it when I said it, never take me alive.”</strong><br><strong>— Killer Mike</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckazrdbfs000s3g68ud93uen2@published data-word-count=63>Mike opens the album thinking about police violence, setting up a scenario where he kills himself knowing that the cops would’ve instead.

He sees it as part of a larger trend of violent policing in New York City. “New York is just this noise, and you’re just erecting these illusions around yourself that sometimes don’t last longer than hours,” he told Vulture. “It’s just jumping from illusion to illusion, just to protect yourself.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckazmp12400443h67j5kejcgu@published>“pulling the pin”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckazmoz10003w3h67knjolo02@published data-word-count=64><strong>“Hate to sound cynical but shit is pitiful, times is just critical</strong><br><strong>Like Jimmy Savile, they cheerfully kill kids in a ritual</strong><br><strong>I’ll murder the miserables, I’ll make it all biblical</strong><br><strong>I’ll cut off their heads, they’ll beg for their lives and I’ll put it up, digital</strong><br><strong>Fuck the political, the mission is spiritual</strong><br><strong>Our murder is miracle, that was sent here to just punish through terror”</strong><br><strong>— Killer Mike</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckazro5pz00353g68hpax21ry@published data-word-count=73>Mike compares corrupt people in power to English TV and radio host Jimmy Savile, revealed after his 2011 death to have sexually abused hundreds, including children.
