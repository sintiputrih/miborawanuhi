He simply commented, ‚ÄúLanguage.‚Äù</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Buzzfeed News</a>, Hickam is a famed NASA member, Vietnam War veteran, author, and the engineer who trained the first Japanese astronauts. His story and memoir also inspired the 1999 movie October Sky starring Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><p>Apparently still riding the high of receiving the internship and not knowing who Hickam is, Naomi tweeted back, ‚ÄúSuck my dick and balls I‚Äôm working at NASA.‚Äù Hickam quipped his own response&nbsp;saying, ‚ÄúAnd I am on the National Space Council that oversees NASA.‚Äù</p><p>After this exchange caught NASA‚Äôs attention, it is reported that Naomi <a href=# rel=noopener>lost her internship</a>. The internet promptly erupted in outrage over the situation, with people picking sides over who they believed was in the wrong.</p><p>One side of the argument says that this situation should be viewed as a lesson in the dangers of inappropriate and crude online behavior.</p><p>Others jumped to Naomi‚Äôs defense saying that the judgment and consequences of her tweet were too harsh. One user noted that she shouldn‚Äôt be held to the highest level of professionalism because she isn‚Äôt even a professional yet, just an excited almost-intern.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Apparently <a href=#>@NaomiH_official</a> lost her internship over this and some think that's appropriate because professionalism etc.</p><p>She's not a professional, she's a not-even-intern excited about joining NASA. If she's not professional, teach her. No need to advance-wreck her career üíñ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kpXY3lycRs</a></p><p>‚Äî Rebecca Roache (@rebecca_roache) <a href=#>August 21, 2018</a></p><p>Still, some users berated Naomi for not knowing who Hickam was and wondered how she could even get herself into the situation in the first place.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Sta7ic/status/1031993937068797952</p><p>Another group of people blamed Hickam, saying that he abused his power. However, Hickam published a <a href=# rel=noopener>now-deleted blog post</a> explaining his side of the story. The post reads:</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Vietnam vet and not at all offended by the F-word. However, when I saw NASA and the word used together, it occured to me that this young person might get in troube if NASA saw it so I tweeted to her one word: ‚ÄúLanguage‚Äù and intended to leave it at that.</p><p>Soon her friends took umbrage and said a lot of unkind things but long after I was gone as I immeadiately deleted my comments and blocked all concerned.</p><p>Later, I learned she had lost her offer for an internship with NASA. This I had nothing to do with nor could I since I do not hire and fire at the agency or have any say on employment whatsoever. As it turned out, it was due to the NASA hashtag her friends used that called the agency‚Äôs attention to it long after my comments were gone.‚Äù</p><p>Later in the post, Hickam said that Naomi reached out to him and apologized for the profanity, which Hickam ‚Äúheartily accepted‚Äù and apologized to her as well. He said that after speaking with her, he believes that she should still be able to work in the aerospace industry and is helping her to secure a job that will top the internship that she lost.</p><p>Hickam also said that he spoke with the people in charge of Naomi‚Äôs former internship to make sure ‚Äúthat there will be no black mark on her record.‚Äù</p><p>What started off as an excited tweet evolved quickly into not only a viral internet frenzy, but also the dissolution of one young woman‚Äôs dream. No matter whose side you fall on in this debate, we can all agree that the power of Twitter can cost us our jobs.</p><p>Next, see how a <a href=#>Nazi scientist helped get the U.S. to the moon</a>. Then, speculate over <a href=#>whether that moon landing was real or not</a>‚Ä¶</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvrdKaZKKmpJq%2Fr7%2FHoqdmoJ%2BisrN5x6KapJmd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
