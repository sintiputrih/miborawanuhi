Continue reading to see some tips and our thoughts on the subject.</span></p><h3><b>The Right Size</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>When shopping for a wedding guest book, it is important to consider its size. Do not rely on photographs to judge the product’s size, as these can be unintentionally misleading. Instead, read the product description for its measurements.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The book should be large enough to grab people's attention; if they do not know it is there, they will not sign it. However, it should also be small enough to allow you to add some decorations to the table and neatly place the pens.</span></p><h3><b>How Many Pages?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The number of pages your wedding book has will depend on how many guests you are inviting. Consider if you are happy for the guests to have a page each or if you want to encourage them to share. You should also consider whether you want extra pages to attach polaroids or souvenirs from your wedding.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you are happy for guests to share the pages and do not want to attach polaroids, you should aim for about ten pages per 50 guests.</span></p><h3><b>Find a Design to Match The Wedding Theme</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>All weddings have a theme or color scheme. Traditional wedding guest books with ivory and gold or white are the most common style of wedding guest book and will likely match most wedding color schemes. You can choose matching color schemes with a minimalist design, or you may want to choose a wedding guest book based on the theme of your wedding.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For instance, if you are planning a nature-themed wedding, you could choose a wedding guest book depicting flora or fauna. You should also consider the style; do you want the cover to look like a painting, a photograph, or a drawing?</span></p><h3><b>Choose A Wedding Guest Book That Opens Flat</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Choosing a wedding guest book that opens flat will allow your guests to utilize more of each page. If a book doesn’t open completely flat, it may prevent guests from writing to the end of the lines. Books that open flat also mean the writer can leave the book open where the next person should write. This prevents accidental damage and overuse.</span></p><h3><b>Choose Your Cover Wisely</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Other than the style and opening flat, you should think about the durability of the cover of your wedding guest book. It should be durable enough to protect the pages from damage. We recommend a hard-backed book. Wood is a unique-looking option that fits the bill.</span></p><h3><b>Built-in Ribbon Bookmarks&nbsp;</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ribbon bookmarks are often attached to wedding guest books. This is a simple feature that you will miss if not included. This saves guests rifling through the book trying to find the right page to write. Waiting in line may put some guests off from writing in it in the first place.</span></p><h3><b>Consider the Type of Pages</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The paper in your wedding guest book should be thick enough not to let any ink run onto the other side of the page. Acid-free archival paper is the preferred type of paper because it will prevent the ink from fading in years to come.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>You can purchase wedding guest books containing lined paper or plain paper. Lined paper will help people write neatly and better utilize the space. When choosing plain paper, you run the risk of one guest using a whole page for only a few words. However, plain paper allows people to get more creative; you may even see some artwork in your wedding guest book.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The plain paper also allows you to attach polaroids and other souvenirs from the wedding more aesthetically pleasing. Traditionally, the pages of a wedding guest book are white or ivory. However, you can choose from different colored pages if you begin your search with this feature.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Photobook Options</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some wedding guest books are made specifically to include polaroids as well as messages from your guests. These have one plain side and one lined side on each page. Black paper is an excellent option for anyone wanting to use polaroids in their book as it makes the photos pop. Combine this with metallic pens, and you will create a very cool-looking wedding guest book.</span></p><h3><b>Foil Edged Paper Adds a Little Sparkle</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>We love gold or silver foil-edged paper. They often catch the light beautifully and make your book look more like a wedding guest book than a guest book in a hotel.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>You May Want to Prompt Guests to Leave A Message</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>A wedding guest book should encourage your guests to leave a message. For this reason, you may want to purchase a book that has a small prompt in the front, asking guests to leave a message and thanking them for doing so. You could also look for a wedding book interjected with quotes about love.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>Are personalized wedding guest books better?<p><span style=font-weight:400>A company may only change a few features to make a wedding guest book personal to you and will charge you more for the service. This can make a massive difference to some couples, especially if they want their wedding day to reflect their personality and romantic journey. However, others are happy with a simple design because the book becomes personalized when guests begin writing in it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>There is also a matter of quality to consider; the personalized aspects will not matter if the book is of poor quality. Of course, there are pros and cons to each, but if you can find a high-quality personalized wedding book, it will be better than a generic wedding book of the same quality because it is more personal to you.</span></p>Do people still use guest books at weddings in 2022?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, most people still choose to have a wedding guest book at their wedding. It is a tradition that is still going strong.</span></p>How many polaroid cameras do I need for a polaroid guest book?<p><span style=font-weight:400>If you want your wedding guest book to be filled with polaroid photos, you should leave two polaroid cameras on the table with plenty of films. You should also place a sign explaining what you want your guests to do with the pictures. Once the wine starts flowing, some guests may not figure out what they should do.</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
