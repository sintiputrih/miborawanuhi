The fans don't always get to learn how loyalty can affect stars' careers, but every now and again, we see stars stay loyalty to their closest people, and it causes some unexpected shake-ups. Jada Pinkett, for instance, once turned down a film due to <a href=#>her loyalty towards Tupac</a>.</p><p>Recently, <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> dropped a documentary, and in the film, we see that emerging star, Anthony Ramos, turned Lopez down. Turns out, Ramos did so as a means to stay loyal to a friend, who had a former connection to Lopez.</p><p>Let's take a look at why Anthony Ramos turned down Jennifer Lopez, and how other stars also turned her down, as revealed in her documentary.</p><h2 id=anthony-ramos-turned-down-jennifer-lopez-due-to-his-friendship-with-marc-anthony-who-39-s-lopez-39-s-ex>Anthony Ramos Turned Down Jennifer Lopez Due To His Friendship With Marc Anthony, Who's Lopez's Ex</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-5-4.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loyalty is a major thing in certain circles, and for Anthony Ramos, his loyalty to Marc Anthony forced him to turn down Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>Ramos was presented with an opportunity to work with Jennifer Lopez, as seen in her recent documentary.</p><p>"Ramos was meant to play the toxic suitor in the film's "Rebound" number, a dance that features Lopez and her partner in a crumbling glass house, attached via a springy rope that keeps pulling them back together — all used as a metaphor for her inability to quit unhealthy relationships," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW reported about the project in question</a>.</p><p>While on the phone with Ramos, Lopez learned that he was not going to work with her, citing his friendship with Marc Anthony as the reason.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, Anthony and Lopez are now exes, after being married for years. EW added that "Lopez and Anthony married in 2004," and that "Lopez and Anthony were married until 2014 (they first separated in 2011), and their twins, Emme and Max, born in 2008."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being friends with Anthony, Anthony Ramos felt it best to turn Lopez down.</p><p>"I didn't know that you and Marc were good friends, I didn't know that. But that's nice," Lopez told Ramos.</p><p>She then went on to elaborate on the project and the role, reassuring Ramos that it wasn't specifically about his friend.</p><p>"He's the father of my kids, obviously. I'm never going to do anything that's going to really pinpoint him out, but it is very meta. It's kind of about the 20-year journey between that last album and this album, and a lot of things happened. There were a lot of relationships that I was in. The thing you're playing is representative of many relationships, not one specific relationship," Lopez explained.</p><p>For Lopez, it was a major blow, as Ramos could have turned in some great work. For Ramos, it was a missed chance at potentially taking his career to the next level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In that same documentary, Lopez was also turned down by a number of stars that she reached out to.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jimmy-page-was-praised-for-the-reason-he-turned-down-a-collab-with-ozzy-osbourne-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jimmy Page Was Praised For The Reason He Turned Down A Collab With Ozzy Osbourne">Jimmy Page Was Praised For The Reason He Turned Down A Collab With Ozzy Osbourne</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jimmy Page earned accolades for turning down a collaboration with Ozzy Osbourne.</p><h2 id=a-recent-lopez-doc-showed-that-many-stars-turned-her-down-including-ariana-grande-and-taylor-swift>A Recent Lopez Doc Showed That Many Stars Turned Her Down, Including Ariana Grande And Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot-2024-02-26-at-11-43-49-am.png><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Cut</a>, Lopez was turned down by a ton of different stars.</p><p>"Taylor Swift is a no,” says one producer. “Jason Momoa is not available; Jennifer Coolidge not available; Lizzo not available,” says another. One producer asks if J.Lo would want Vanessa Hudgens, to which the star responds, “For what?” It is quickly revealed that she’s actually unavailable, too. Adding on to the people who couldn’t/wouldn’t participate, a producer tells Lopez that Ariana Grande is unavailable. Snoop Dogg is as well. In an earlier scene, Lopez tells a friend that Anthony Ramos declined to participate in the project because he is “good friends” with Lopez’s ex-husband, Marc Anthony," the site summarized about the now-infamous scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While learning of all the people that turned her away, Lopez was rather blunt about what was unfolding.</p><p>When speaking with her manager, Lopez said, "I don’t wanna force anybody to do this who doesn’t go, ‘This is going to be fun.'"</p><p>"Nobody wants to say ‘no’ to me, Benny, I get that. But when an actor doesn’t like a script, or doesn’t think it’s good enough, or is worried about it, that’s what they’ll say. I know that. I’ve done it," she added.</p><p>Per the site, Lopez was eventually able to secure some big names, including Jane Fonda, Post Malone, and Keke Palmer.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-28t152959-519.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition ">Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Howard Stern didn't hide his expression after Ben Stiller revealed the major film he passed on.</p><p>Anthony Ramos' loyalty to his friend led to him turning down a major acting opportunity with Jennifer Lopez.
