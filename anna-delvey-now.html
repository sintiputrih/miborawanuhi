The whole point is that you need to sit there and think about what you did. Some people get degrees, others exercise, but Anna is drawing pictures of herself in a simple style. Mostly they are of her being defiant in the face of criticism. That she has no regrets, call us crazy, but selling drawings of you saying you have no remorse for your crimes will not look good at your next parole hearing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Anna Delvey (@theannadelvey)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If you are interested in purchasing any of her art and stick it to the man, go to her website at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop Anna Delvey</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where has Anna been?</h2><p>Sorokin was arrested in October 2017 for theft of services. She spent the time between her October 2017 arrest and April 2019 conviction for fraud and grand larceny at the Rikers Island jail complex, one of the most notorious prisons in New York. She was held at Rikers Island during her trial, which began in March 2019 and concluded a few weeks later. She was transferred to Albion Correctional Facility soon after and released on parole in February 2021. Her visa expired in the first half of 2021 — leaving her with no choice but to spend nearly a year in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.</p><p>As she wrote in an essay for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> in February 2022, she spent a few months at the Orange County Correctional Facility in New York and the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey, among other facilities.</p><p>News about Sorokin's deportation started to make the rounds only recently. As one of her lawyers, Manny Arora, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>, the deportation order was signed on Feb. 17, 2022. He emphasized that the authorities should only be able to start the deportation process after March 19, 2022, since they should legally have 30 days to appeal, but there is some concern that Anna has already been deported.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have been asked by my partner to stop doing the Julia Garner Anna Delvey voice and referring to various rooms in the apartment as the gray discotheque VIP lounge</p>— Tijuana Maxx (@byalexzaragoza) <a href=#>February 10, 2022</a></figure><p>"I haven't heard from Miss Sorokin this afternoon, and so I am working under the presumption that she is being deported," Manny said on Monday, March 14, 2022.</p><p>"Legally, they should not be able to deport her until [March 19]. That is due to the deportation order being signed on Feb. 17, 2022, and that allows us to have 30 days to file an appeal," he said. "But we are dealing with bureaucracy, and there are numerous filings in her case, so you just never know if there was a paperwork error."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Anna refused to comply with the authorities at the airport on March 14 and refused to board an evening flight from New York to Frankfurt, Germany. It remains to be seen whether or not Anna is still in the United States.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>(L to R) Julia Garner as Anna Delvey, and Alexis Floyd as Neff Davis</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"My visa overstay was unintentional and largely out of my control," Anna Sorokin (aka Anna Delvey) wrote in 2022.</h2><p>"My visa overstay was unintentional and largely out of my control," Sorokin wrote in Insider.
