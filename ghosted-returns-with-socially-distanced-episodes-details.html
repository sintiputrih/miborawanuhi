I didn’t actually have a place somewhere else, but I was never at home because I was always traveling,” Lindsay told Us in November 2020. “And so for us, you know, we know how to work this out and navigate it, and obviously we have an end goal in mind. This is not a forever situation.”</p><p>New episodes of Ghosted: Love Gone Missing kick off on MTV Monday, February 8, at 7 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6hp6OpsqV50Z6rrqqeqHq4tdOhZKynk56urbjYZpuiq6SWu6Sxw2acqaGjpLGmv4ydnK2ZmaHAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
