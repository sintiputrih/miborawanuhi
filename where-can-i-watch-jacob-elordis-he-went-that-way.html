The film, which was shot on location in Los Angeles, takes on the classic buddy road trip story format as the improbable duo, joined by Jim’s celebrity chimpanzee, Spanky, drives across Route 66 over three days, but gives it a dark thriller twist when they start testing each other’s limits.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where can I watch He Went That Way?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zachary-Quinto-Jacob-Elordi-He-Went-That-Way.jpg><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Fair warning, He Went That Way is currently sporting a harsh rating of 24% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, but if you’re still curious to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elordi</a> and Quinto in action, you can do so by catching the film in select theaters, as well as buying or renting it.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>The Head Gear Films/Teashop Productions/Mister Smith Entertainment production was released in theaters on Jan. 5, 2024, a year after its exclusive premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.
