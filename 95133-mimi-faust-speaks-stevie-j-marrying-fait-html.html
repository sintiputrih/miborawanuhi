I don’t know. I saw it on the blogs. I don’t know sh*t. Listen, if it’s real, Congratulations to the both of them. Faith, Stevie. Congratulations Faith. I don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p class=Wg>And while it appeared Mimi was genuinely happy for the couple, she suggested Faith wear a pair of her eyeglasses before signing any contract with the father of her daughter, Eva Giselle.</p><p class=Wg>“I think I need to give you a pair of my glasses because you need to read that contract thoroughly. Born and Fed. Faith, I think you might need to get a pair of glasses to read that marriage certificate or whatever prenup he wants you to—I don’t know what he asked you to sign but read it thoroughly. I don’t know. Congratulations though. Y’all got a whole football team.”</p><p class=Wg>And as a parting shot, Mimi added,</p><p class=Wg>“All that I can say is better her than me. More power to the people and goodnight.”</p><p class=Wg>Stevie and Faith reportedly tied the knot in Las Vegas on July 17.
