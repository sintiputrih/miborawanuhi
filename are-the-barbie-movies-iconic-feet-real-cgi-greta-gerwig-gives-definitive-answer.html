As anyone who has actually worn the things knows, this does not normally happen, and it has blown minds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I need to know everything about this shot. How many takes, if she held onto something, was she harnessed, is the landing mark sticky, are they her feet, who did the pedicure, really just a documentary on this shot <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8a87KsFtXP</a></p>— chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) <a href=#>April 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Now, people can thankfully sleep soundly at night as director Greta Gerwig has clarified these are indeed Robbie’s real feet. On the Australian talk show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Project</a>, the 39-year-old says they thought about using CGI for all the feet in the film when characters are in Barbie’s world, but this would have been too hard.</p><p>“‘Are you going to CGI all the feet?’ And I thought, ‘Oh god, no! That’s terrifying! That’s a nightmare.’ [Margot] has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. She should just hang on to that bar.”</p><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true>The film’s star has also addressed the imagery elsewhere, too. A recent TIME report reveals the shot took eight takes, and Robbie really did hold onto a bar in order to keep her feet flexed. She does not like it when someone subs for hands or feet in insert shots, and the 33-year-old has been in similar territory before. During the filming of The Suicide Squad, she really did a stunt where she took out a character with her legs while handcuffed to the ceiling, only to then use her feet to grab the keys and unlock herself using her toes. Director James Gunn was justifiably <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mesmerized</a> by all of it.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Whether the Barbie movie contains something similar or other shots as interesting as the feet remains to be seen. Audiences will find out for themselves July 21 and, in the U.K., the piece has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slapped</a> with a rating blocking those younger than 12 from seeing it on their own unless accompanied by an older adult.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKudXam1pnnBmqmboZViurDCyJ6qZqGTpLuqr4yfnJ6sXaeyoriMnJ6iZZensrWtjKCcq6%2BZnHqotdWeqmaclZu2r7XToq2eZZGjwLix0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
