There are back-flips and somersaults, some characters are pounded face-down into the ground while others have epic action sequences.</p><p>Most of these scenes require&nbsp;professional stunt and body doubles to take over if they're too dangerous for actors to engage in, but often, some&nbsp;actors are firm in their decision to put in the work themselves. Zoe Saldana is one of them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Gunn shared a series of tweets today, giving fans a look&nbsp;at the masks created for body doubles, while revealing the two actors were "athletic and good at up close stunts".</p><p>Gunn never had the opportunity to use the masks for stunt doubles, because Pom and Zoe did most of the work themselves.</p><p>The Suicide Squad&nbsp;writer-director also shared a picture of Gamora's body dummy they created during the first film, since the outer space floating scenes were filmed underwater.</p><p>When a fan expressed their surprise at Zoe doing her own stunts, since&nbsp;Gamora's character&nbsp;demanded&nbsp;immense training and pre-prep, Gunn declared that she did a lot&nbsp;of them on her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Amanda Seyfried Turned Down A Role In ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’</a></span></p><p>"We have competent, talented stunt doubles for both Zoe & Pom. That being said, @zoesaldana does do way more than most..." he shared, revealing&nbsp;the actor did "wire gags & fighting" which most actors can't or wouldn't do.</p><p>Saldana is obviously committed to her character, although after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her death in Avengers: Infinity War</a>,&nbsp;it's hard to imagine her return.
