Be encouraged.”</p><p>It has been two years since Chance the Rapper and Kirsten Bennett welcomed their youngest daughter. Chance recently discussed the notion of having more kids during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> magazine.</p><p>“Not right now,” <a href=#>Chance the Rapper</a> said when asked about having more kids. “It’s a lot to try and be a good dad right now,” the celebrity shared. “With all the distractions and all the things that I’m limited in doing by living in Chicago and being a person of notoriety. I don’t wanna tack on anything,” the recording artist explained.</p><p>“I want to get my relationship with Kensli down pat and also just get older. I’m 23. I had her when I was 22. If I am gonna have more kids, it’ll be a blessing and I’ll accept it as a responsibility and a privilege, but I’m definitely not trying to have more kids right now.”</p><p><a href=#>Chance the Rapper</a> and Kirsten Bennett’s oldest daughter, Kensli, celebrated her sixth birthday in September. Marli turned 2-years-old in August.</p><p>Photo: Chance the Rapper/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmampfZ4Jwr8eapZydXam1pnnRmqepnaJirq%2BwjLCgn51dmLKtscGrmK2dXZi1s7XSraSaq12strW0jK2fnqGiYriqsNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
