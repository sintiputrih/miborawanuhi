But rather than take umbrage with Biden’s eyebrow-raising claim that “the pandemic is over” (developing nations would like a word, sir), Allen, unfortunately, pandered to much lower hanging fruit to roast the president.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>“Biden was on 60 minutes. I heard he asked how long the show was,” Allen tweeted, echoing everyone’s least favorite uncle at Thanksgiving dinner this year, probably.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Biden was on 60 minutes.

But beyond that, once his tweet began to go viral, no shortage of people piled on Allen to school him on how to actually eviscerate someone on Twitter.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>And comparatively, to even Joe Biden, there is no shortage of material to roast Allen on — from the fact that his best days are behind him to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting 86’ed from Lightyear</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tim Allen said he was famous.
