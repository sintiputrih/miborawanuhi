Many feel that Kanye is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">parading her around</a> and publicly degrading her. However, people are still following the rap superstar anyway. That led to him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">calling out the complainers</a> in a short video at an airport.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose. So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking 'bout, 'Why you posting your wife?'" Kanye goes on to explain, "Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-shows-bianca-his-romantic-side>Kanye Shows Bianca His Romantic Side</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Georgia-born multi-hyphenate is not going to slow down with the relationship updates any time soon. That was especially true this Valentine's Day. Kanye posted a picture of massively beautiful red rose bouquets that were for Bianca. She commented on the post, "My love." Fans were flooding the post with references to his Late Registration track "Roses." While the song is a tribute to his grandmother's health scare, the title of the song was too good of a reference to pass up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Kanye West's gift to Bianca Censori for Valentine's Day?
