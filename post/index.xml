これまでにも多くのところで車すきを公言し、インスタやツイッター・ブログでも愛車に対する言及は多くありました。
根っからの車好きのGACKTさんですが、
自分の愛する愛車を傷つけたれたとしたら、
想像もしたくないほどのキレっぷりを披露しそうな・・・、
とりあえず、怖そうなイメージが先行してます。。笑
そんな車を傷つけられたら怖そうなGACKTさんですが、
昨日、自身のインスタの中で、当て逃げに遭ったことを明かし、
その当てられた後の対応のスマートさを讃える声に満ちています。
GACKTが接触事故で神対応
GACKTさんは２月１１日に自身のインスタを更新し、
「いきなりボクのベントレーの横っ腹に右折してきたクルマがぶつかってきた。クルマは傷ついたものの、怒りより衝撃をほとんど感じなかったベントレーの強靭さに感動。ま、クルマは直せばいい。怪我はなかったし怒る必要もなし。
A car hit my Bentley suddenly. I got impressed with the strength of the Bentley. It just needs to be repaired. I don’t need to get angry. 」引用元：GACKTインスタ
と更新し、ファンを心配させたのと同時に、
その対応の大人さに「神対応」と賞賛されているのです。
GACKTさんが乗っていたベントレーに、
横から右折してきた車に衝突されたそうですが、
その車に乗っていた人は、その後どうしたのか・・・。
GACKTさんのラインがその日のうちに更新されると、
自分のインスタの投稿がニュースになっていることに驚きながらも、
相手はそのまま逃げてしまったことを明かしました。
ラインでのGACKTさんは怒ってる様子はなく、
むしろ相手が怪我をしてないか気にかけてました。
その余裕はどこから来るのか？
GACKTさんはやっぱりかっこいい！！
GACKTに怪我はない？ GACKTさんには何も怪我はないようですが、
仮に怪我していたら大変なことになってました。
体が資本のアーティストであり、
今年は世界中でライブを行うことが予想されており、
仮に怪我でライブのパフォーマンスに支障が出たら最悪です。
相手は逃げていますし、
損害賠償も求めることはできませんし、
いろんな意味で散々なことになっていました。
怪我がなくて本当に良かったですが、
GACKTさんが乗っていたベントレーは無事だったのでしょうか？
愛車のベントレーに傷は？ GACKTさんはインスタの中で、
