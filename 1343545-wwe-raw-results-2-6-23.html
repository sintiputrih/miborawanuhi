He’s the king of comebacks at this point, and it’s getting silly. They are here for one reason, The Judgement Day. The Judgement Day is his fault. What he created worked too well. Each member is in a better place than they were last year. Edge puts over each member of The Judgement Day, except Dominik, who is just there, too. Edge gives The Judgement Day a golf clap for what they managed to do to him and his wife at Extreme Rules.</p><p>They just made it worse. He’s a sick, vindictive bastard who will do anything to get his pound of flesh. Phoenix asks if they have the stones to… but is quickly interrupted by The Judgement Day. Finn Bálor notes that every time Edge comes back, he gets beaten down by them. Dominik chimes in and threatens to do something to them that he learned while he was doing hard time (wait..what?). Damian Priest says they are going to end the two of them if they don’t learn their lesson. Priest fumbles his line about the Elimination Chamber and accidentally says Money in the Bank.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>GLAM SLAM to <a href=#>@DomMysterio35</a>!!!</p><p>Hey <a href=#>@RheaRipley_WWE</a>, did ya see that one?! ?<a href=#>#WWERaw</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aUuqH1WJUN</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>February 7, 2023</a></p><p>Eventually, Phoenix challenges Bálor and Ripley to a tag match against her and Edge at Elimination Chamber. Bálor agrees but jokes that the match can only happen if they make it to the Elimination Chamber. The Judgement Day surrounds the ring. The Street Profits make the save. Edge Spears Bálor as Priest is clotheslined over the top rope by Angelo Dawkins. Dominik tries to run away, but Montez Ford tosses him back into the ring. Phoenix drops Dominik with the Glam Slam.</p><h4>Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match: Damian Priest vs. Angelo Dawkins</h4><p>Dawkin dropkicks Priest. Priest rolls out of the ring to collect himself. Dawkins pounces Priest clear over the announce desk. Priest catches Dawkins with an elbow as he sails through the air for a spinning splash. Priest lands the broken arrow. Dawkins kicks out. Priest works over Dawkins. Dawkins fires up and sends Priest out of the ring. Priest sees it coming and levels Dawkins with a lariat. Vertical suplex out on the floor by Priest. Priest leaps off the ring steps and lands a back leg front kick (shoutout to Tony Schiavone).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This means EVERYTHING to <a href=#>@AngeloDawkins</a> right now!<a href=#>#WWEChamber</a> <a href=#>#WWERaw</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g0FowCKTUd</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>February 7, 2023</a></p><p>After the break, Dawkins walks right into a superkick from Priest. Leaping flatliner by Priest. Dawkins kicks out. Priest tries another broken arrow, but Dawkins reverses it into a spinning butterfly neck breaker. Dawkins hits a Swanton… yes, you read that correctly. Priest kicks out. Dawkins is apoplectic. Priest and Dawkins trade stikes. Cyclone boot by Priest. Priest lands South of Heaven for the win.</p><p>Winner- Damian Priest</p><h4>WWE Raw Results Continue On The Next Page!</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtam5sZWLEuLGMq5iwZaKawLa406xka2VmYn90</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
