Be aware of your food and drink</strong></h2><p id=eTY_jcO90wa6 data-wc=61>Coffee, tea and red wine can quickly cause yellow or brown stains to form, so small things like being aware of avoiding these drinks if possible, or drinking these through a straw may help to keep teeth white and avoid stains. The nicotine in smoking can also stain teeth, so it goes without saying to avoid cigarettes too for whiter teeth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a3a43041e0e-white-teeth-z.jpg><h2><strong>How does avoiding certain foods whiten your teeth?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ex62S1vlX-l4 data-wc=22>Food colouring stains teeth by binding to the tooth surface.

Visit your doctor</strong></h2><p id=e7-IzGR6QOiQ data-wc=54>Something most people don’t know is that health issues like diabetes, oral cancer, anaemia and some eating disorders can also cause damage to the tooth enamel and oral health, which can result in yellow teeth.

Brush your teeth correctly</strong></h2><p id=eJtgYmsGHGQ3 data-wc=60>Instead of brushing teeth aggressively with a hard grip - which can be a natural response - try to hold your toothbrush at the very end and use a grip as if you’re holding a pen. This will reduce pressure to the brush and the teeth, therefore protecting them from damage. All of these things can contribute to whiter teeth.</p><p id=ePmt11iXm3Ad data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>This professional water flosser will actually make you want to floss and it’s an Amazon bargain</a></p><h2><strong>How does brushing your teeth whiten your teeth?</strong></h2><p id=ep3VrcrOovFS data-wc=13>Brushing your teeth gently reduces damage, and protects them, leading to whiter teeth.</p><p id=ewEFXO28rU1e data-wc=12>You can add <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Whites Beaconsfield</a>'s new every day whitening toothpaste to your routine.</p><p id=edPpOV_IPJJ4 data-wc=18>The specially formulated toothpaste whitens, detoxes the mouth, dissolves stains, kills bad breath, removes plaque and remineralises teeth.</p><h2><strong>4.
