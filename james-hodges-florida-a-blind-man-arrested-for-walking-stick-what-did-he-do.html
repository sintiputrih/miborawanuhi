The reason behind his arrest was he was carrying a gun with him, as per the Police.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But after some time, the news came in public saying that he did not have any gun with him when Police tried to arrest him and send him to jail.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>How can the Police be this careless for someone to arrest? He claimed to have a cane with him in his back pocket when Police thought it was a gun.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After some investigation, Police admitted that they might have seen a gun because of the morning fog. The blind man was innocent, and he was released after some time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He did not do any illegal work to get arrested; he was just an ordinary person walking in the morning carrying his walking stick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Police who arrested him have also been temporarily out from his work; the arrest was unacceptable. Before making an arrest, they must be clear about what they are arresting the people for.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The news about the man is still trending when people find out it was fake news about his getting arrested for a weapon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, the information about James is clear: he did not do any illegal work against the government to get arrested.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hodges was released the same day after some investigation; he did not spend a day in jail after his arrest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>&nbsp;You may want to read: </b>The Challenge Australia: Is Ryan Gallagher Dating Charlotte Crosby?
