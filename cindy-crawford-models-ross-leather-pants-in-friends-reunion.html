Friends: The Reunion had hundreds of hysterical moments, but the most iconic segment may have just been the fashion show portion of the evening — namely when Cindy Crawford strutted her stuff in Ross Geller’s very tight, very pasty leather pants. 
As one might recall, Ross (David Schwimmer) wiggled himself into some skin-hugging leather pants for a hot date. But, add some heat, baby powder and heck of a lot of sweat to the equation, and he ends up naked in the bathroom with “pants paste."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And, according to <strong>Erica Cloud</strong>, who was in charge of wardrobe for the reunion, it’s because they fit her “perfectly.”<span class=Apple-converted-space><br></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cindy-Crawford-Hilariously-Models-Ross-Leather-Pants-Friends-Reunion-001.gif?w=480&quality=86&strip=all"><p class=p1>She told <a href=#>Popsugar</a>: “They are the EXACT Agnés B. pants that Ross wore, and they fit her perfectly! No one else has worn them besides those two icons! She even wanted to carry the baby powder and lotion down the runway, but they need up doing no props.”<span class=Apple-converted-space><br></span></p><p class=p1>Crawford wasn’t the only star to make a guest appearance in Friends clothes from episodes’ past.<span class=Apple-converted-space><br></span></p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong></a> also hit the stage — twice! She opened the show in none other than Rachel Greene’s (<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>) pink and poofy bridesmaid’s dress from Barry and Mindy’s wedding in season two. Staying true to script, she even flashed her red underwear!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Before Delevingne returned in the always iconic holiday Armadillo costume, <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> walked the runway! He did a little dance in Ross’ Sputnick costume. The cast was clearly surprised by his arrival, as Schwimmer stood up in excitement and Aniston screamed, “What?!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The evening’s models certainly had a good time, as Delevingne even took to Instagram to share her excitement and some backstage photos.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>She captioned the post: “Could I BE any more excited??? Being a part of the Friends reunion was truly a dream come true. I grew up watching the show religiously and feel so lucky to have been included in this incredible special with such an amazing group of people. Plus, I got to be the HOLIDAY ARMADILLO. You’ll laugh, cry and feel like they never left.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i2r7DYZpqrmaebvLOwjKamnZ2cqHqzu9KsZKWdkam1pr6MqZinrKNitq95xaugnqaUqHqzsdSnoKimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
