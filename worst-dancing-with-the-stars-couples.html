She named "Sharknado"&nbsp;star Ian Ziering, with whom she was paired during the show's fourth season in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>"The fact that his name's not ee-an, and it's eye-an makes me wanna throw up,"&nbsp;Burke declared on the podcast (via&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>). Discussing Ziering's actorly intensity, Burke admitted that he wore on her. "Think of spending time with that for, like, eight to 10 hours a day, seven days a week for three months,"&nbsp;she added. Asked if that made her want to quit the show, she quipped, "No, but it made me want to slit my wrists ... I was, like, crying to the executives. I was, like, 'Is there any way to please to just eliminate us?'"</p><p>Burke's comments were hit with backlash, and she <a href=#>tweeted</a> an apology — not to Ziering, but to anyone she'd offended by making light of suicide. In 2021, Burke admitted during an episode of her <a href=#>"Pretty Messed Up"</a> podcast&nbsp;that she'd come to regret her words. "I was completely out of line,"&nbsp;she said, publicly apologizing to Ziering. "I just took it to that next level of just nastiness." In 2023, Burke revealed she sent Ziering a personal apology via email, and that the hatchet had been buried.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkZ350g46wpqurpGKxorrCoqWgZaeewal506GcZquklr%2B0ecKorKmklah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
