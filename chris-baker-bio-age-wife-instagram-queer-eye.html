There, she serves to develop, implement and monitor strategic plans to drive TOOF’s mission.

Before starting the nonprofit organization, he has also worked at a few music festivals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Furthermore, he is also a fine public speaker. One of his remarks that touched us was his idea of “home” — “I subscribe to the idea that home is a concept. It’s a nebulous thing. It’s not a place or a building necessarily, but having ‘homefulness’, a house helps with that.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his education, Chris graduated from the</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> State University of New York</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> at Oneonta in 2007.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Chris once struggled with substance use and spent many nights sleeping on the streets before 2009.</span></p><h3><b>Is Chris Baker On Instagram, Facebook?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of January 2022, Chris entertained 290 followers over Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>it_aint_christopher</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.
