I am obsessed with these white chip chocolate cookies. These Black and White Chippers are a rich chocolate cookie with a combination of white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Every time I used to go shopping with my Mom at the mall, we would visit Paradise Bakery and pick up their famous black and white chippers. I wanted to create a soft and chewy chocolate cookie just like Paradise Bakery!</p><h3><img decoding=async title="Hunka Hunka Triple Chocolate Cookies by Modern Honey" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0894-copy6.jpg alt="Hunka Hunka Triple Chocolate Cookies by Modern Honey - www.modernhoney.com" width=3026 height=2814 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Growing up, my Dad sang Elvis Presley songs non-stop.

Out of the entire 6th grade, there were 3 of us who were called up and told that they just couldn‚Äôt quite figure out where we belonged.</p><p>Basically, we were horrendous.</p><p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve sung in public since that day. Now it‚Äôs a completely different story in the comforts of my own home, car, or shower because I still belt out those songs. I without a doubt sing out of tune and off-key but it‚Äôs all good. I accepted and came to term with the fact that I was not blessed with the musically talented gene. üôÇ</p><p>Is this a good time to tell you that my sister-in-law played Glinda from Wicked on Broadway?</p><p>I digress.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triple-Chocolate-Cookies.jpg alt="Hunka Hunka Triple Chocolate Cookies are a perfect rich, soft, and chewy chocolate cookies with chocolate chips and white chocolate chunks.

I named them Hunka Hunka after that famous Elvis song and because they are a big, thick, hunk of a cookie. Even though it‚Äôs thick, it is still the perfect mix of a gooey, rich chocolate brownie and a soft, warm cookie. I can‚Äôt even.</p><p>These triple chocolate cookies are chock full of both chocolate chunks AND white chocolate chunks. If you have been to Paradise Bakery or Panera Bread and devoured their black and white chippers like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, then you will appreciate these cookies. White and Dark Chocolate Chip Cookies are insanely amazing! If you love chocolate, you will go crazy for these chocolate chunk cookies.</p><p>Did I tell you they are easy to make?

It also creates air pockets in the dough which gives the cookies some rise.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp; Add eggs one at a time</strong>, mixing well after each addition.</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp; Use high-quality cocoa</strong>.&nbsp;Get the good stuff because it‚Äôs the star ingredient.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp; Chilling the dough</strong> makes the cookies even better. It‚Äôs hard to be patient but it is worth the wait. 24-48 hours is best but even an hour will make a difference. It also helps to keep the cookies from spreading too much.</p><p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Bake just until cookies has crisp edges and chewy centers</strong>. Keep an eye on the cookies as they reach the allotted baking time. <strong>Don‚Äôt burn the cookies</strong>.
