The Australian-American singer and activist Helen Reddy died on Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020. Her 1972 hit song “I Am Woman” became a feminist anthem and rocketed her into her role as a feminist icon. It also became the title of a 2019 biopic about her life, in which she was portrayed by Tilda Cobham-Hervey."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Our hearts are broken. But we take comfort in the knowledge that her voice will live on forever.”</p><p>Throughout her 78 years of life, Helen married and divorced three times. In 1961 (when she was 20 years old), she married Kenneth Claude Weate, an older musician and family friend. Their daughter Traci was born in 1963, and they divorced in 1966.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 1968, Helen converted to Judaism and married Jeff Wald. Their son Jordan was born in 1972. Jeff was Helen’s manager for a time, and their relationship was quite volatile. Helen initially filed for divorce in 1981 but changed her mind a day after filing. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>People</u></a>: “It was my understanding that [Jeff] was going to discontinue his use of cocaine.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 1983, Helen once again filed for divorce, then started dating Milton Ruth (a drummer in her band). She and Milton got married, then divorced in 1985. They had no children together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are Helen Reddy’s children now?</h2><p>Both of Helen’s children went on to pursue careers in show business, though neither followed their mother’s musical career path exactly.&nbsp;</p><p>“I come from such a long lineage of performers – my mother's parents, her sister, my cousin, and yet I had no interest,” Traci said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Now to Love</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Traci grew up following her mother to gigs and auditions and got a close-up view of her mother’s meteoric rise. Traci herself pursued a career in the movie industry, eventually directing the 1989 film A Nightmare on Drug Street. She and her husband Lucas Donat attended film school together and got married shortly after graduating. They now run the ad agency <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tiny Rebellion</u></a>. They have a daughter named Lily.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Helen’s son Jordan has also worked in entertainment. He clearly inherited some of Helen’s musical abilities, working as a music consultant and music supervisor on a few films. He has also worked as a producer. He was the segment producer on The Roseanne Show and received a co-producer credit on I Am Woman. He and his wife Yasmina have three children: Grover, Oliver, and Mia.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Jordan, Traci, and the rest of Helen’s family and friends as they mourn their loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKtsc1mqZ6clK56pLTIpZurnZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
