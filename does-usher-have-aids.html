In 2012 the singer paid $1.1 million to a celebrity hair stylist who claimed she had contracted an STD from Usher.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>In 2017, a suit was filed against the 45-year-old by Laura Helm, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed he gave her herpes</a>. She was asking for $20 million and the case was dismissed with prejudice which suggests there was some kind of financial agreement, although the amount has not been disclosed. Around the same time as the Laura Helm case, Two other women also made claims against the star and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a man even came forward with the same accusations.</a></p><h2 id=h-does-usher-have-aids-or-something-else data-injectable=false>Does Usher have AIDS, or something else?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1724309857.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Most of the lawsuits against Usher have claimed that the women who slept with him contracted HSV-1, also known as the herpes virus. There is nothing to suggest that the singer has the AIDS virus which is a completely different disease.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>However, just like HIV-AIDS, there is no cure for the Herpes virus, meaning if you contract it, you’re stuck with it for life. There are medicines and ways to treat the symptoms, and people who have the disease can live pretty normal lives, but it never goes away.&nbsp;According to leaked court papers from the first lawsuit the singer supposedly contracted the virus around 2009 or 2010.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>During the case against him in 2017 the pop star made no public statements confirming or denying anything, but, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Forbes</a>, the singer’s interim manager, Grace Akinlemibola, has since come out and stated that Usher has denied having herpes. She went even further by saying “Many of the lawsuits against Usher were filed by people who don’t even have the disease.”</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>So it’s hard to say with 100% certainty whether Usher truly does have the disease. However, according to California law, failing to disclose an STD to a sexual partner is a misdemeanor. The outcomes of the lawsuits in 2012 and 2017 plus the number of people who have spoken out about Usher certainly suggest that the singer could have an STD and was knowingly spreading it at the time, but nothing can be confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZqysoJWneqmt1Z5kmqGUqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
