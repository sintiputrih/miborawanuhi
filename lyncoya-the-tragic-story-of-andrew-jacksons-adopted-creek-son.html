Coffee described a fierce battle, in which the Muscogee fought fearlessly to protect their homes and families, but were ultimately overwhelmed by the massive number of attackers. As noted by <a href=#>Slate</a>, the soldiers killed all the men who had lived in the village and set houses on fire. One of the soldiers was&nbsp;frontiersman <a href=#>Davy Crockett</a>, who would later briefly describe the massacre, saying only, "We shot them like dogs."</p><p dir=ltr>Many children were orphaned in the attack. As described by the <a href=#>National Parks Service</a>, one of the survivors was an infant boy, still holding onto his mother's body. This baby would soon attract the attention of Andrew Jackson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkXBwcWtfocavr86ymGasmJp6tb7AoKCcZaOpvLPFjKidZpmemb%2Bmw4yjmJyjo6S7tHnAnaaprJWZeqS%2BxJ6iZqufo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
