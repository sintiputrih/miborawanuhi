But Work It is a rare actually good entry in the emerging genre of Netflix teen movies, buoyed by well-choreographed dance numbers, cute boys, genuinely clever dialogue, and a Sharpay-tier performance from <a href=#>Keiynan Lonsdale</a> (and if you know me, you know Sharpay-tier is the highest tier). It’s still a Netflix teen movie, so I felt very old and very confused throughout the whole thing. Here are a ton of questions I had while watching Work It, with maybe, like, two answers. I had to learn what a dance belt was the hard way, and now you do, too.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckdqg8sin001x3h68symzmyl0@published data-word-count=31>Does this high school just frequently host assemblies for its dance crew to show off its latest routines, tied to nothing?
