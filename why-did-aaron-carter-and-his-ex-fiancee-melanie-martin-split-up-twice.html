He was the opening act to his older brother Nick's band Backstreet Boys when he joined them on tour. Carter's next album, Oh Aaron, also went platinum. But after his huge success as a pop icon, Carter never quite reached the same success in his later life.</p><p>According to the California Child Actor's Bill, Carter's parents were supposed to have put 15% of his earnings into a Coogan Account. But the "Crush On You Singer" <a href=#>claimed he got much less</a>. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a> in 2016, "I got, like, $2 million when I turned 18 years old. I should have had at least $20 million in my account." He also alleged that his father shot a .44 magnum near his ear, which caused him to go 70% deaf in one ear, in order to coerce him into signing a $256,000 check.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Carter and his mother, Jane, appeared in the TV reality series Marriage Bootcamp: Family Edition. The series focuses on attempting to repair strained relationships through unconventional therapy. In an appearance on The Doctors in 2019, Carter disclosed that he had been diagnosed with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He also admitted to abusing drugs that led to him being arrested numerous times.</p><p>Aaron is survived by his son, Prince Lyric and his fiancée <a href=#>Melanie Martin</a>. Their relationship was tumultuous and was marred by multiple accusations and arrests for domestic abuse. But how many times did the couple break up and get back together?</p><h2 id=aaron-carter-had-melanie-martin-39-s-name-tattooed-on-his-face>Aaron Carter Had Melanie Martin's Name Tattooed On His Face</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron Carter went public with his relationship with Melanie Martin in January 2020. He shared a picture of the couple on Instagram with the caption: “She loves me she loves me not, she woke me up from napping, but I’m not complaining.” In February of that year, he raised eyebrows when he referred to the lash bar owner as his “wife.” He wrote: “Notice HER comes first always put your woman first before your own selfish needs. That’s what my daddy always taught me. Do right by your woman happy wife happy life.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Nick Carter's Restraining Order Against His Brother Aaron</a></span></p><p>Three months later, Carter debuted a new face tattoo of Martin's name over his eye. He later joked that the ink "says 'mistake,'" and "not Melanie." But things went dramatically left, when Martin was arrested and booked for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">domestic violence.</a> Shortly after, Carter revealed the pair had split, posting a photo captioned, "Bachelor's life is no life for a single man. #Single."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Three weeks after their split, Martin and Carter revealed they were back together and expecting a child in April. However, Martin sadly suffered a pregnancy loss in June. "She suffered a miscarriage due to stress conditions," he said via a YouTube video at the time. "We're gonna give it some time, let her heal, and then we're going to try again. We both want that. I gotta take care of her."</p><h2 id=aaron-carter-broke-up-with-melanie-martin-after-accusing-her-of-communicating-with-his-estranged-twin-sister>Aaron Carter Broke Up With Melanie Martin After Accusing Her Of Communicating With His Estranged Twin Sister</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Days after sharing the heartbreaking miscarriage news, Martin and Carter revealed via Instagram they were engaged. "Love wins #iloveyou3000 #engaged #fiance #ourlovestory," he captioned a photo of her ring at the time. On November 22, 2021, Martin underwent an emergency C-section following 13 hours of labor. Carter shared a photo of their first child, a boy named Prince, via Instagram. "My fiancée is in great health thank you lord and the incredibly sweet loving staff here. Prince is precious, I love you son," he wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts to Lamar Odom Fighting Aaron Carter, Calling Him a Bully</a></span></p><p>One week after Prince's arrival, Carter revealed the pair had split once again. The "Crazy Little Party Girl" singer claimed she had been secretly communicating with his twin sister, Angel. "I have the most conniving deceiving family and Melanie has been lying to me the whole time communicating with my twin sister and the family members who tried to put me in prison and who tried to get a conservatorship on me in court," he tweeted on November 30.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one week after announcing via Twitter that he and Martin had split, the on/off couple appeared to reconcile as the model shared a sweet snippet of Aaron cuddling with their son. But in February of this year, Carter took to social media to confirm the couple's decision to split once again. "My relationship has come to a point where we have to part ways. Please respect my privacy at this time. Thank you," Carter tweeted, noting that he had no plans to start dating again yet. "I'm too scarred, and I can't trust any woman. So I'm going to protect my soul and my heart at this time."</p><p>Carter filed for a restraining order against Martin on February 23, claiming his ex-fiancée caused him "emotional distress, anguish, shoving and scratching." According to court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us</a>, Carter accused Martin of being "verbally abusive, taunting and antagonizing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He further claimed she would not allow him to "get any sleep all night long, shooing and scratching" him. Carter alleged that she was "disposing medication down the toilet" and had been "emotionally abusing [him] by threatening to kill herself which caused him worry about the safety of [their] child." The filing requested Martin to stay 100 yards award and to move out of his home.</p><p>In response, Martin sought a restraining order against her Carter after he allegedly "punched" her on her left side during an argument on February 21 and broke several of her ribs. "We had a fight about me talking to another man while we were broken up. He punched me in the left rib and pushed me," she claimed in the filing. "I didn't feel the pain until a few days later, then I left the house because he threatened to give me a restraining order." She claimed in the docs that Carter threw her and their son out of the house after the fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aaron-carter-tried-to-go-rehab-to-gain-custody-of-his-son>Aaron Carter Tried To Go Rehab To Gain Custody Of His Son</h2><p>Aaron Carter checked himself into a rehabilitation program for a fifth time after losing custody of his son. Martin and Carter got back together shortly before his untimely passing. They filmed a video of themselves at Starbucks as they explained their current custody situation. Martin's mother currently has custody of the couple's son under a court order.</p><p>In the video, Carter claimed he had begun a month-long outpatient program with Los Angeles-based Lionrock Recovery to do so. He admitted having 100 seizures from a "dusting" addiction and spending $200,000 on rehabilitation to make the couple a "fully functional family." But sadly it wasn't to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecCaqaimXZius8DEq2SappRitaq%2FjJ6vZp6ZlrukscRmpJ6kkaO2pnnMmqmtoZ5iwLG4yK1krqhdqcSqr8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
