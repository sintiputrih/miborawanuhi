For the time <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that Zen was alive</a>, Mariah knows that Nick gave that boy all of the love in the world because that is the kind of man he is when it comes to his kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>HL has reached out to Mariah’s rep, but we haven’t heard back. The “One Sweet Day” songstress never got remarried after her split from Nick in 2014, and she also hasn’t had any more kids. Nick,&nbsp;meanwhile, has since welcomed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>five children</a> with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three different women</a>. One of those kids was his baby boy Zen, whom he shared with&nbsp;model <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alyssa Scott</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>On Dec. 7, Nick announced on his radio show that Zen passed away of a brain tumor two days prior.&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;</i>host&nbsp;revealed that the tumor started to grow quickly at the end of November, and that he was able to be by his son’s side when Zen died. Alyssa initially <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mourned Zen’s death</a> by sharing short videos of her baby boy to her Instagram Story. The following day, Alyssa shared a video tribute to Zen alongside a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>heartbreaking message</a>. It read in part, “The&nbsp;soreness I felt in my arm from holding you is slowly fading away. It’s a painful reminder that you are no longer here. I caught myself looking in the backseat as I was driving only to see the mirror no longer reflecting your perfect face back at me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49yZqaZop6uqXnCmqmesV2nsqKvx56bZqelqXqvtcKkZJyZnqO8r3nDnpitoF2ovK952Z6lZp2omLm2v8ivnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
