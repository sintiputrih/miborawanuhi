It is with heavy hearts and deep sorrow that we share the news of the profound loss suffered by the Richland County Sheriff’s Department. The entire law enforcement community feels this pain, and our thoughts and condolences are extended to our brothers and sisters in uniform.&nbsp;On behalf of Sheriff Lewis and the dedicated staff at the BCSO, we offer our sincerest condolences to the Richland County Sheriff’s Department. We stand in solidarity with our fellow officers during this difficult time, recognizing that their loss is felt deeply by all who wear the badge.</p><p>We kindly ask our community to join us in lifting the Richland County Sheriff’s Department up in prayer. In times like these, the power of collective support and unity is immeasurable. Let our thoughts and prayers be a source of comfort and solace for our colleagues as they navigate the profound pain of losing one of their own.&nbsp;Our hearts are heavy as we also extend our condolences to the family of Deputy Salrin. Losing a loved one in the line of duty is an unimaginable burden, and our hearts ache for the family as they grieve the loss of their beloved Deputy.</p><p>Deputy Salrin was a dedicated and exemplary law enforcement officer who joined the Richland County Sheriff’s Department in 2022. His commitment to his duty was evident in his pursuit of excellence, as demonstrated by his graduation from the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy in January of 2023. His remarkable dedication was further acknowledged when he was honored with the SCCJA Clifford Moyer Marksmanship Award at his graduation—a testament to his skill and dedication.&nbsp;Deputy Salrin eagerly embraced his role as a patrol deputy, where he was assigned to serve the southeast Richland County community. His dedication to the safety and well-being of the citizens he swore to protect and serve was unwavering.</p><p>As the Richland County Sheriff’s Department mourns the loss of their brother in blue, we express our gratitude to the community for their unwavering support. In times of tragedy, it is the strength of our community that uplifts us and reminds us that we are never alone in our sorrow. Funeral details for Deputy Salrin will be released in the coming days, allowing us the opportunity to come together as a community and pay our respects to a brave officer who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to others.
