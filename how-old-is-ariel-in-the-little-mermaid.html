This avid explorer is said to be 21 years old, but we barely know how old this mermaid princess is. Was Ariel’s age ever revealed in this Disney Princess franchise?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-ariel-in-the-little-mermaid data-injectable=false>How old is Ariel in The Little Mermaid?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Disney has given mixed messages when it comes to the lore of The Little Mermaid. For example, the live-action adaptation somewhat disregarded the canon that was told in the&nbsp;animated series when it comes to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what kind of fish Flounder is</a>. The same can be said for Ariel’s age as it remains inconsistent, despite it being the same story.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>In the animated film, Ariel tells her father that she’s 16, making her old enough to visit the human world. If this age was canon in the live-action picture, then there would be a 5 year age difference between the human prince and mermaid princess. However, that is not the case in the 2023 adaptation. But don’t worry, the age gap isn’t that drastic.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo!</a>, it was revealed that Bailey’s Ariel is 18 years old. It reported that Disney’s production notes described Ariel as a “spirited 18-year-old.” However, this age is not mentioned anywhere in the movie, and it doesn’t help at all when there are characters like Sebastian, who constantly calls Ariel a child.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>While it’s unknown why the age was changed, it’s probably because of the relationship between her and Eric. Remember, the prince is 21 years old in this movie. So having Ariel’s age be somewhat closer to his rather than a 5-year age difference might be more appropriate, especially when the film went to great lengths to change some of the lyrics of its iconic songs to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">promote the message of consent.</a></p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=66 data-injectable=false>The Little Mermaid&nbsp;is now available to stream on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnIrGSaqpmauW61zWaroZ1doba1wMueZKadoqKuqrCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
