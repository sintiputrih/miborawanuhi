But after season two's disappointing run, fans were worried that even more divorce announcements would be coming down the pipeline. Not to mention, would-be couple <a href=#>Kyle and Deepti bummed everyone out with their post-season romance</a> and their subsequent breakup further marred the show's record.</p><p>Very few couples have found marital bliss thanks to Love is Blind, but one couple did beat the impossible odds. Amber and Matt Barnett from season one of the show are still married in 2022, and seemingly very happy.</p><h2 id=amber-and-barnett-got-married-after-season-one-of-love-is-blind>Amber And Barnett Got Married After Season One Of Love Is Blind</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Amber and Matt Barnett (who goes by his last name on the show) <a href=#>admitted that they nearly got a divorce</a> after walking off into the sunset post-Love is Blind, they are still married as of September 2022 and seem to be as happy as ever.</p><p>That said, the couple didn't have an easy go of it while the show was filming, or, really, anytime they got together with their castmates.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: Everything Love Is Blind Contestants Have Said About The Show">The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: Everything Love Is Blind Contestants Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>Although Barnett chose Amber and proposed to her in the Love is Blind pods, he also dated Jessica, who felt their connection was stronger and more authentic than Barnett's with Amber.</p><p>The drama added some interest to the show, but in real life, Amber and Barnett simply avoided Jessica and life went on. But viewers weren't always a hundred percent sure that their favorite on-screen couple would make it through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-everyone-was-rooting-for-amber-and-barnett>Not Everyone Was Rooting For Amber And Barnett</h2><p>Jessica wasn't the only person who wasn't thrilled with Amber and Barnett's marriage at first. <a href=#>Some fans did think that Barnett was a good match for Jessica</a>, and there were also concerns about the on-screen moments between Barnett and his bride.</p><p>Thus, many viewers were surprised that of all the former couples from the reality series, Amber and Barnett managed to stick it out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans who went back to rewatch season one were still baffled by the pair's connection</a>, with one Redditor suggesting, "Amber is the worst ever. She's a pick me girl and a narcissist."</p><p>Many fans criticized the way Amber seemed to latch onto Barnett, saying she appeared insecure and dependent on him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Love Is Blind Cast Says This Is The Best Thing About The Netflix Show">The Love Is Blind Cast Says This Is The Best Thing About The Netflix Show</a></span></p><p>A user even admitted they started to empathize with Barnett's second choice, saying, "I really felt bad for Jessica towards the end."</p><p>One commenter summed it up well by noting, "I agree that the whole thing on Season 1 with them was messy and she is messy. But they are still married so as messy as they may be, I really wish them the best."</p><h2 id=are-amber-and-barnett-going-to-have-kids>Are Amber And Barnett Going To Have Kids?</h2><p>After all the drama settled, Amber and Barnett were still together, and seem poised to keep their marriage strong over the long run. But fans have another question about their future, and that's whether the Barnetts plan to have kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Especially since Amber discussed wanting to be a stay-at-home mom during their time dating in the pods, fans were expecting the couple to have a baby right away.</p><p>But in interviews since they tied the knot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber explained that she and Barnett wanted to take the pressure off their relationship</a> and enjoy being together, the way they would have had they dated for real prior to getting married.</p><p>Amber also explained one of the reasons for delaying starting a family was because Barnett was very "analytical" about the decision, not wanting to jump in until he felt the couple was totally ready.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Do Nick and Vanessa Lachey Really Think Of 'Love Is Blind'?">What Do Nick and Vanessa Lachey Really Think Of 'Love Is Blind'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, there's the fact that Amber was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2021 after a seizure resulted in Barnett walking in and finding her on the floor, unresponsive.</p><p>Fans are just hoping that the couple is able to have kids when the time is right for them, and that they continue to be one of few Love is Blind success stories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51doby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnBmqmnnaSpeqK6w2aYppqVp3q0wMilo2asn5yytbTEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
