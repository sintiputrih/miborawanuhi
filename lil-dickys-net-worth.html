The song went viral, with over a million views in just 24 hours.</p><p>This seemingly overnight success, on the other hand, was deliberate.</p><p>Burd had been working on singles and music videos for years in anticipation of the release of his first two mixtapes, “So Hard” and “Hump Days.”</p><p>He had so much material ready that he released a new song once a week for the next five months after the publication of “Ex-Boyfriend.”</p><p>As a result, he was able to build a loyal following by releasing music regularly.</p><p>Burd started a Kickstarter effort in late 2013 after releasing 32 songs, 15 of which had music videos.</p><p>He added that the publication of content had depleted his finances and that he was now reliant on the support of his supporters.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign was a huge success, nearly surpassing its $70,000 objective.</p><p>He did his first live event in February 2014 as a thank-you gift to his followers to tide them over while working on new music.</p><p>Burd signed with CMSN in the same year, an independent rap label that also manages a slew of other well-known musicians.</p><p>Burd published his first album, “Professional Rapper,” on his own on July 31, 2015.</p><p>It reached number 7 on the US Billboard 200, number two on the US R&B chart, and ranked one on the Indie, Country, and Rap top albums charts.</p><h3>Lil Dicky’s Income</h3><p><strong>Lil Dicky makes $100,000 a year on average.

The rapper’s album sales also speak for themselves.</p><p>Even though he has only released one full-length album, it sold over 20,000 copies in its first week and reached the top ten Billboard Hot 200 albums chart.</p><p>Furthermore, Lil Dicky has over five million monthly Spotify listeners, with “Freaky Friday” receiving over half a billion plays, implying that the rapper will be making a healthy monthly income from streaming services as well.</p><p>Burd has amassed a substantial fortune outside of music and YouTube, thanks to a lucrative endorsement deal with companies such as Trojan condoms.</p><p>In addition, he produced and starred in the FXX series Dave, in which he portrays a fictitious version of himself.</p><h2>Lil Dicky’s Net Worth in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look at Lil Dicky’s Net Worth in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Euro</td><td>€ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":6825880}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>6,825,880</span></td></tr><tr><td>Pound Sterling</td><td>£ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":5845817.600000001}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>5,845,818</span></td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollar</td><td>A$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":11015495.999999998}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>11,015,496</span></td></tr><tr><td>Canadian Dollar</td><td>C$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":10128560}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>10,128,560</span></td></tr><tr><td>Indian Rupee</td><td>₹ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":590485600.0000001}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>590,485,600</span></td></tr><tr><td>BitCoin</td><td>฿ 188</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Lil Dicky: House & Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><p>Mr. Dicky now has the financial means to purchase a multimillion-dollar home in Venice, California, one of the hottest real estate markets west of the Mississippi.</p><p>According to records, Mr. Dicky paid an even-steven $2,500,000 for the 2,162-square-foot villa, which is just a few streets from the hopelessly famous Abbott Kinney Boulevard.</p><p>The property is surrounded by a charming white picket fence (with a vine-covered arbor).</p><p>The plot is a teeny-tiny.07-acre, characteristic of Venice’s densely packed housing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lil-dicky-house.png><p>The roughly Craftsman-style cottage was recently re-imagined by prolific local designer Barbara Bestor, despite being erected in 1922.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Lil Dicky admits to driving his grandfather’s 14-year-old Toyota Avalon, which is his only vehicle.</p><p>However, he claims that the phrase “save dat money” is a real-life slogan.</p><p>The 2020 Avalon has a starting price of $35,875.
