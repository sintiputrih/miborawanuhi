The documentary follows the latest squad of cheerleaders throughout the 2023 season as they train to become members of one of the most exclusive teams in the world - despite suffering painful injuries and being paid just over the minimum wage for their efforts - with many of them needing second jobs - despite the Dallas Cowboys being worth $8 billion."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is about a sisterhood that they are able to form, about relationships that they have for the rest of their life.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders: The history of the iconic uniforms" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/285ba95b5311-gettyimages-1177979079.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders: The history of the iconic uniforms" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders: The history of the iconic uniforms</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Viewer backlash after true salary exposed in doc" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0b2a59328f29-americassweetheartsdallascowboyscheerleaderse300190209.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Viewer backlash after true salary exposed in doc" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Viewer backlash after true salary exposed in doc</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eN3Dc37Dd2O0 data-wc=33>“They have a chance to feel like they are valued, they are special, and they are making a difference.
