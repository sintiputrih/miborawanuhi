That’s big, come on. I win. I could take you.”</p><p>The date ended abruptly when Stause asked the guy what her name was, and he couldn’t remember.</p><p>“A handshake is brutal!!

I may have missed the colorful memo today but everyone’s outfits were on point. Does anyone here watch Selling Sunset for the fashion? Or what’s your favorite part of the show: the fashion, the real estate, the drama or the cast?? Or is it just all of the above!?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stause also joined in on the fun.</p><p>“Selling homes in the hills is easier than walking the hills in heels!
