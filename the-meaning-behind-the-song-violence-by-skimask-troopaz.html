The lyrics depict a life immersed in violence and crime, where street prowess and dominance reign supreme. It talks about gripping guns, kicking down doors, and pulling triggers. The references to the North Memphis lifestyle and the Skimask Troopaz crew highlight a gritty reality that exists within certain communities.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_2_Playa_Dres_Anthem></span>Verse 2: Playa Dre’s Anthem<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mista Playa Dre takes over in the second verse, representing the South side and perpetuating the themes of violence and dominance. Dre’s lyrics emphasize the serious and relentless nature of the Troopaz crew. The use of vivid imagery paints a picture of a fearless individual, armed to the teeth, ready to protect their territory at all costs.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_3_No_Remorse></span>Verse 3: No Remorse<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Killamac returns in the third verse, intensifying the message of violence and disregard for human life. The lyrics convey a lack of remorse or empathy, with references to leaving victims lying on the floor and showing no love when aiming at throats. The idea of being caught up in the Troopaz crew and the impending demise of those involved showcase the consequences of a life mired in violence.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_4_Collaborative_Expression></span>Verse 4: Collaborative Expression<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The final verse, performed by both Mista Playa Dre and Killamac, showcases a shared mentality and camaraderie within the Skimask Troopaz. It reinforces their commitment to causing chaos and instilling fear in others. Themes of loyalty, firepower, and no remorse dominate this verse, solidifying their reputation as a force to be reckoned with.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_Behind_the_Song></span>The Meaning Behind the Song<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Violence” doesn’t glorify violence; instead, it serves as a raw depiction of the reality faced by individuals in certain communities. The lyrics shed light on the environment where these artists grew up and the desperate measures they felt compelled to take. The song encapsulates the struggle for survival in a world where violence is prevalent and sometimes unavoidable.</p><p>While some may find it challenging to connect with the themes presented in “Violence,” it is essential to acknowledge and address the underlying socioeconomic factors that feed into the realities depicted in the song. It serves as a stark reminder of the need for social change and support for communities that face systemic disadvantages.</p><p>As a fan of Skimask Troopaz, I appreciate the rawness and authenticity of their music. While their lyrics may shock and disturb, they also provide a glimpse into a world that many of us may never fully understand. “Violence” holds a significant meaning for me as it serves as a reminder of the everyday struggles faced by those living in marginalized communities.</p><p><b>Album Title:</b> Ski Mask Troopaz (1996)</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Credits></span>Credits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Written By:</b> Skimask Troopaz</p><p><b>Recorded At:</b> Memphis</p><p><b>Release Date:</b> January 1, 1996</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmatoqecmruksYybsGarm566or%2FKZqurp5%2Blrrt7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
