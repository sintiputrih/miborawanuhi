He finds and captures the source of the electricity's failure, a wild Pikachu that was chewing on the wires, and goes to release it back into the wild. He encounters his rival, <a href=# title="Gary Oak">Gary Oak</a>, and finds out that he has gotten his Pokémon Trainer's license and will begin his journey in one week and brags to Ash about it. Gary's goading and some encouragement from Gary's sister, <a href=# title="Daisy Oak">May</a>, causes Ash to decide that he will get his own license. Ash succeeds in getting his license and will begin his journey a week later. While attempting to capture a wild <a href=# title="Pidgey (Pokémon)">Pidgey</a>, Pikachu goes missing and gets attacked by a herd of wild <a href=# title="Spearow (Pokémon)">Spearow</a>. Ash manages to rescue Pikachu and rushes it to the <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a> so that it can be healed from its injuries; when Pikachu notices that Ash is risking his life to save it, Pikachu jumps up and defeats the leader of the Spearow herd, a <a href=# title="Ash's Fearow">Fearow</a>, with a powerful Electric attack and Ash manages to capture it. Pikachu is later healed while Ash has to deal with an angry <a href=# title="Misty (anime)">Misty</a>, whose bike he had stolen and accidentally destroyed while fleeing from the Spearow herd.</p><p>Ash travels to <a href=# title="Pewter City">Pewter City</a> and battles the <a href=# title="Gym Leader">Gym Leader</a>, <a href=# title="Brock (anime)">Brock</a>, and manages to defeat him and win his first <a href=# title=Badge>Badge</a>.

Ash battles Misty for the Gym Badge with the requirement being that Ash has to retrieve his stolen <a href=# title="Ash's hat">hat</a> (that Misty had stolen earlier). Ash manages to defeat her, get his hat back, and win the Gym Badge, much to Misty's frustration.</p><p>After a failed attempt at raising his Trainer level, a distressed Ash decides to go find something that can help him find higher ranked Pokémon. He goes searching for the A-rank Pokémon, <a href=# title="Clefairy (Pokémon)">Clefairy</a>, after finding a store that sells maps that can help find rare Pokémon. He manages to find a Clefairy and chases it around <a href=# title="Mt. Moon">Mt. Moon</a> where he eventually ends up in Clefairy colony. Here, Ash meets <a href=# title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a> and his friend <a href=# title=Bill>Bill</a> where they have lived with the Clefairy for a month to study the ways of their evolution patterns.

He decides to stay at the Gym to do some training so he can battle Sabrina again when she suddenly goes missing.

Ash, Brock, and a group of other people who have been fighting the Black Fog decide to avenge Sabrina by capturing the monster in giant <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Ball</a> specially designed to capture it called the "Enormo Poké Ball—X1". They find the Black Fog at the Pokémon Tower where Ash battles it; in the battle the Black Fog manages to destroy the giant Poké Ball but becomes too weak to resist even a normal size Poké Ball. Ash attempts to capture the monster with an <a href=# title="Ultra Ball">Ultra Ball</a> but it commits suicide with <a href=# title="Self-Destruct (move)">Selfdestruct</a> before it can even reach it. While Sabrina felt sorry for the monster's death and cried for it, Ash cried simply for the fact that Ultra Ball he threw cost him the last of his allowance.</p><p>Ash later travels to <a href=# title="Fuchsia City">Fuchsia City</a> to participate in a Pokémon race and meets a young woman named <a href=# title="Lara Laramie">Lara Laramie</a>. When Ash finds out that a conniving young man named <a href=# title=Dario>Dario</a> is rumored to have broken Lara's arm, preventing her from participating in the race, he decides to race in Lara's place.

After doing some investigating, they find out that he is an inductee to a group of people who love Pokémon that are evolved with stones known as the "<a href=# title="Knights of the E Stone">Knights of the E Stone</a>". When Mikey is yelled at the group for not evolving his <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a>, Ash steps in to defend him and they are given a challenge to see if Mikey gets to join the group. Ash and Mikey manage to beat their challenges and Mikey is inducted into the Knights of the E Stone while Ash denies his own offer to join the group.</p><p>Sometime later, at a local Pokémon Center, Ash, <a href=# title=A.J.>A.J.</a>, and <a href=# title=Samurai>Samurai</a> discuss a legend about a <a href=# title="Hidden Village">Hidden Village</a> filled with high level Pokémon that is protected by a goddess. They decide to go and search for the village but Pikachu accidentally gets separated from the group while talking to a wild <a href=# title="Squirtle (Pokémon)">Squirtle</a>. After a week of searching, Ash is eventually reunited with Pikachu after it returns from the Hidden Village (where it went to search for him).</p><p>After accidentally working Pikachu to exhaustion, Ash and company decide to go to the country so that it can get some rest and relaxation. They encounter a herd of wild Pikachu and manage to befriend them. Ash becomes jealous when Pikachu starts spending all of its time with the other Pikachu and tries to find other ways to occupy his self. When <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> decides to attack and capture the Pikachu herd, Ash and Pikachu battle and defeat them. The next day, Ash, convinced that Pikachu wants to stay with the other Pikachu, decides to leave with Brock and Misty but he gets a happy ending when Pikachu comes back to stay with him.</p><p>Ash, Brock, and Misty go to see a movie called "Clefairy in Space", that Ash greatly disliked, mainly due to him knowing that Clefairy aren't aliens like the movie portrays them as. Ash meets up with Professor Oak again and is invited to dinner after Oak finishes his television appearance. Later, the dinner is disrupted by a wild Clefairy that attempts to steal food in order to restock its food supply. After managing to stick a tracking device on it, Ash and Oak search for the thieving Clefairy and eventually end up at the house of <a href=# title="Mimi (EToP)">Mimi</a>, where they find <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a>, <a href=# title=James>James</a>, and <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a> attempting to steal Mimi's newly befriended Clefairy.

He meets <a href=# title="Florinda Showers">Florinda Showers</a>, a young rich woman whose city has sunk into the sea, and her butler, <a href=# title=Potter>Potter</a>. Ash finds out that Team Rocket has scammed Florinda of all her money by selling her fake <a href=# title="Leaf Stone">Leaf Stones</a>.

They later encounter Team Rocket a second time; Florinda defeats them with her <a href=# title="Gloom (Pokémon)">Gloom</a> and Ash takes his leave to the Pokémon League as they admit their love for each other.</p><p>Later, at the league, Ash manages to win his first match with his newly evolved <a href=# title="Kingler (Pokémon)">Kingler</a> while Brock and Misty have already been defeated. As he taunts them for mocking his skills and not being anything special themselves, Pikachu goes running off. Ash finds Pikachu eating with the Pikachu of another Trainer, <a href=# title=Ritchie>Ritchie</a>, and befriends him. Ash and Ritchie easily win most of their matches and end up in the fourth round, Ash vs. <a href=# title="Jeanette Fisher">Jeanette Fisher</a> and Ritchie vs. Gary.

The next battle is between Ash's Pikachu and Ritchie's Pikachu, <a href=# title=Sparky>Chuchino</a>; both knock each other out with their powerful <a href=# title="Thunder (move)">Thunder</a> attacks. Their third and last battle is between <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">Ash's Charizard</a> and Ritchie's Charizard, <a href=# title=Zippo>Charley</a>; as the battle goes on Ash's Charizard greatly damages Ritchie's Zippo; Ash throws the match in order to prevent Zippo from suffering any longer. Ritchie later manages to cheer Ash up by saying that his Zippo will be alright after being healed while Brock tells Ash that Charizard will one day see him as friend and listen to him; they then go to cheer on Ritchie as he goes through round six.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Orange_Islands>Orange Islands</span></h3><p>Several months later, Ash travels to the <a href=# title="Orange Archipelago">Orange Archipelago</a> to start a new journey. As he walks through <a href=# title="Valencia Island">Valencia Island</a>, he encounters a baby <a href=# title="Ash's Lapras">Lapras</a> being attacked by a group of <a href=# title="Krabby (Pokémon)">Krabby</a> and rescues it.

They find out that the real thief is in fact, a wild <a href=# title="Ash's Snorlax">Snorlax</a>, and attempt to stop it from eating all of the fruit.

At first, Ditto's <a href=# title="Transform (move)">Transform</a> causes some trouble for Pikachu because it can copy its moves but Pikachu manages to win using its greater speed that Ditto can't copy to defeat it.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/37/Ash_winning_EToP.png/300px-Ash_winning_EToP.png decoding=async width=200 height=192 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Ash after defeating Drake<p>As the match continues, Ash finally manages to get Drake down to his last Pokémon, his <a href=# title="Drake's Dragonite">Dragonite</a>. After Ash's Squirtle is defeated, Ash sends out his next Pokémon, Charizard. Charizard and Dragonite have an intense battle in the air, but despite being larger and powerful, Charizard is eventually defeated. With Charizard defeated, Ash is now down to only one Pokémon, Pikachu. Pikachu, at first, is completely unable to even hurt the larger and more powerful Dragonite but manages to win when it crawls into Dragonite's mouth and shocks it from the inside. With Dragonite defeated, Ash becomes the winner.</p><p>Sometime before, in a story that takes place before Ash traveled to the Orange Archipelago, Ash meets up with Gary again sometime after the Indigo League. Ash and Gary decide to have a competition to see who can capture a recently found (and stolen) giant <a href=# title="Slowpoke (Pokémon)">Slowpoke</a> first. The Slowpoke's abilities make it nearly impossible to capture, but Ash uses his quick thinking and finally manages to capture it first. Ash soon trades his newly captured Slowpoke for a picture of May gorging herself on some food.</p><p>Ash's journey comes to an end when James is seen sending his mother a letter detailing his recent adventures; it is shown that Gary is now traveling with him.<br clear=all></p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Currently_owned>Currently owned</span></h3><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=1.7716049382716><tr><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Ash's Fearow"><img alt="Ash's Fearow" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1a/Ash_Fearow_EToP.png/300px-Ash_Fearow_EToP.png decoding=async width=200 height=102 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b><span id=Fearow></span>Fearow</b></td></tr><tr readability=5.6288659793814><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=6.5670103092784><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Ash's Fearow">Ash's Fearow</a></i><p><a href=# title="Fearow (Pokémon)">Fearow</a> is the second Pokémon that Ash managed to capture.
