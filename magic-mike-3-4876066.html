That’s Super Bowl Weekend and Valentine’s Day Weekend. The film was originally supposed to be released only on HBO Max, but then Warner Bros. decided to give it a theatrical release. The movie will stream on HBO Max at some point after its run in theaters, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>.</p><h2>‘Magic Mike 3’ Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Channing Tatum is returning as Mike Lane for&nbsp;Magic Mike 3. In an interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>, Channing revealed that he nearly turned down the movie because of the intense preparations to get in shape.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“It’s hard to look like that. Even if you do work out, to be that kind of in shape is not natural,” he said in Feb. 2022. “That’s not even healthy. You have to starve yourself. I don’t think when you’re that lean, it’s actually healthy,” he added. Channing revealed he worked out twice a day and ate extremely healthy to prep for&nbsp;Magic Mike 3.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Channing has confirmed that this will be his final time playing Magic Mike on the big screen. “I want it to be the Super Bowl of stripping,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in February&nbsp;about the third movie. “I want dancing like we’ve never been able to do in the other two movies, because we had to be honest to what the reality of that world is, which isn’t great dancing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Salma Hayek is the lead female star in&nbsp;Magic Mike’s Last Dance. She’s playing a wealthy socialite named Maxandra Mendoza. “It’s the strongest love story, the strongest female character, from beginning to end,” Salma told People&nbsp;about her role. “How lucky am I?” She also teased that the film will feature <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an epic lap&nbsp;dance</a> from Channing. “If you thought he could dance [before], you are going to realize you haven’t seen anything,” Salma explained in the Aug. 4 interview. “His dance skills—he just got better.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/magic-mike-3-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Thandie Newton</a></strong>&nbsp;was originally supposed to be Channing’s co-star in the film. She exited the project “to deal with family matters”, a Warner Bros. spokesperson told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>&nbsp;in April 2022. While nothing is confirmed, there have been rumors that Thandiwe and her husband <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ol Parker</strong></a> split up, which could be why she quit the film.</p><h2>What Will ‘Magic Mike 3’&nbsp;Be About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/magic-mike-3-ec-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>We got a full glimpse at&nbsp;Magic Mike 3&nbsp;in the trailer that came out Nov. 15. It shows Mike heading to London to resume his stripper career. Wealthy socialite Maxandra Mendoza helps Mike jumpstart his career. And as expected, they start falling for each other! “You came along and gave me this magical moment that made me remember who I really was,” Maxandra tells Mike. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donna Summer</strong></a>‘s song “Last Dance” fittingly plays in the trailer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The official plot description for&nbsp;Magic Mike’s Last Dance&nbsp;reads, “Mike Lane takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, following a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking bartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads to London with a wealthy socialite who lures him with an offer he can’t refuse…and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike discovers what she truly has in mind, will he—and the roster of hot new dancers he’ll have to whip into shape—be able to pull it off?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ONE.

There’s a splash zone in the movie, so it’s a for real thing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Channing has also talked about how the lead female character (played by Salma) is pivotal in the movie.&nbsp;“It’s going to have a really strong, almost stronger than Mike, character that’s female,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “We’ve never done a traditional love story, and this isn’t a traditional love story.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Screenwriter Reid Carolin previously said that the third film is “about a woman stuck at a horrible strip show like a Chippendales and then realizing, ‘What the hell am I doing here?’ And then Magic Mike comes down from the ceiling.
