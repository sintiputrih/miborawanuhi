John Madden noted that some coaches use the capsules during games, although they are mostly for players’ use. Following the 2005 season, Mora signed a three-year contract extension with the Falcons, which guaranteed the final two years of his original five-year deal, and added a sixth in 2009.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jim L.
