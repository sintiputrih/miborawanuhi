Recommended Videos Leading up to Harlow’s forthcoming album, Come Home The Kids Miss You, the leaked track arrives before that album’s song list has even been announced. Hot New Hip-Hop reports that the song surfaced online Wednesday night, featuring a short segment of Jack’s verses, but a much more substantial portion of Drizzy’s verses that are thought to be the entirety of his feature on the song."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Drake also acknowledged at the time that Pusha’s mic drop-worthy diss track was “a hell of a chess move,” despite thinking the song itself was “trash.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46dqZqjlWKwsLnErGSfp6Jivba%2Fx5pkrWWWpL9uwMeeZKahnKG2sLrToWStoZ2aerC6jKWcmqOVmXqrrcKkZKGZoqG8uHnTq5ico18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
