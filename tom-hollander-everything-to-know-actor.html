The 56-year-old played Mr Collins in 2005’s Pride and Prejudice, Cutler Beckett in Pirates of the Caribbean, Gary in Bird Box and most recently, as Quentin, Tanya’s new friend who she suspects wants to murder her, in The White Lotus.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Naomi Watts, Tom Hollander and Chloe Sevigny star in the new show</figure><p id=eraMrEilrGU data-wc=36>He will also star as Truman Capote in the upcoming drama Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans - which looks at the true story behind the famous author’s fallout with the ladies of New York’s high society.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d7d6933184dd-0510thewhitelotuss02.jpg><h3>What’s the story behind the paycheck?&nbsp;</h3><p id=ePZvxPmb4bDJ data-wc=63>Chatting on Late Night with Seth Myers, he explained: “I went to see my friend who was doing theatre in England for 300 pounds a week, you know, but doing great work, Chekhov, and I sat smugly in the audience having just done a BBC show for 30 grand or something which was going to get me through the next year or so.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc8138b7ae99-tom-holland-crowded-room-premiere.jpg><p id=eJMbMwalXWAP data-wc=75>“I was thinking, 'Well this is marvellous. I'm very prosperous, but my good friend Peter is doing this great play and I'm going to go afterwards and see him and slightly patronise him and say how wonderful it was. I thought I'd check my emails, and I got an email from the agency saying, 'Payment advice slip: Your first box office bonus for The Avengers,’ And I thought, 'I don't think I'm in The Avengers.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68fa50db4be8-gettyimages-1956490106.jpg><p id=e43nB3lanwNv data-wc=64>"It was an astonishing amount of money. And it was not his salary, it was his first box office bonus. Not the whole box office, the first one. And it was more money than I've ever — it was a seven-figure sum. He was 20 or something. So my feeling of smugness that you remember I had in the first half disappeared very quickly.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Tom Hollander reveals how he was cast in BBC's Us&nbsp;" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5fb3e76eb306-us-tom-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Tom Hollander reveals how he was cast in BBC's Us&nbsp;" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Tom Hollander reveals how he was cast in BBC's Us&nbsp;</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Apple TV+ shows coming back this year: all the details from Bad Sisters season 2 to Slow Horses season 4" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0b158d0faa34-bad-sisters-group-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Apple TV+ shows coming back this year: all the details from Bad Sisters season 2 to Slow Horses season 4" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Apple TV+ shows coming back this year: all the details from Bad Sisters season 2 to Slow Horses season 4</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The White Lotus 'delicious' season three cast revealed - and includes Harry Potter star" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ccfc3d123719-ka03thewhitelotuss02.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The White Lotus 'delicious' season three cast revealed - and includes Harry Potter star" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>The White Lotus 'delicious' season three cast revealed - and includes Harry Potter star</a></h5></li></ul><h3>Is Tom married?</h3><p id=eXosjrhUTkyG data-wc=61>Tom is in a relationship with his long-time girlfriend Fran Hickman.

He previously opened up about becoming a parent back in 2011, saying: “I’d love to be a dad, it’s just that I’ve not managed to sort it out… And I do occasionally think, “How have I managed not to settle down when I came from such a settled-down family?”’ The couple have kept the baby’s name and gender private.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uaGtoZGl8tbvMZp%2BopJyWu6Wx0Wacr52irsGptc2gZK2nXaC7sMOMmpqtp6Jk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
