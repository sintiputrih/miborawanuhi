However, the lyrics do not feature any proper nouns (except for a shoutout to the Pacific Coast Highway). Based on this, one can say the lyrics have a general applicability. What they speak to is the vocalist basically telling her ex that even though he may regret hooking up with her to begin with, her remorse in that regard is even worse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>An Unorthodox Song</h3><p>Tis piece is a bit unorthodox as far as breakup songs go.&nbsp;Usually in these cases, one party or the other is clearly presented as the villain, i.e. the one who propagated the relationship’s dissolution.&nbsp;Or even if it is an amicable breakup kind of scenario, there’d often be some kind of sorrow expressed on the part of the vocalist along the way, i.e. her lamenting how things didn’t work out.</p><p>Well actually in this song, the singer does lambast the addressee a bit in terms of being a drunkard who “<strong>can’t seem to handle the truth</strong>”. However, she doesn’t really harp on his shortcomings. She also expresses sorrow in terms of dealing with him romantically overall.&nbsp;But concurrently, Riley is at least able to recognize that she too, in his eyes, proved to be a less-than-ideal partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Regret-Me-by-Daisy-Jones-The-Six-Lyrics.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Daisy Jones & The Six?</h3><p>Daisy Jones & The Six is actually a fictitious band. The band was modeled after Fleetwood Mac.&nbsp;Actually it was created for the purpose of starring in an Amazon Prime series which itself is titled&nbsp;Daisy Jones & The Six.&nbsp;However, the creators of the show went all out and actually assembled an original album, titled&nbsp;“Aurora”, in the band’s name.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Release of “Regret Me”</h3><p>“Regret Me” has an issuance date of 25 January 2023.
