To save money, he lives like a college student.</p><p>On the other hand, this young man has amassed several lovely homes in various locations. Kirk’s residence is a three-story property on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kirk-house-1024x683.jpg><p>This home, too, includes four bedrooms and two fireplaces, as well as a nursery attached to the master suite.

Similarly, this estate is located on Michigan’s coastline, making it the ideal summer getaway home for athletes.</p><p>This house, too, has three bedrooms and four and a half baths.

Despite his celebrity, he manages to live a simple life free of controversies.</p><h2>Washington, Minnesota, Endorsements, Book Publications</h2><h3>Washington</h3><p>In the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft, Washington selected Cousins, becoming the team’s second quarterback after taking Baylor’s Robert Griffin III with the first overall choice.</p><p>Cousins spent his rookie season as Griffin’s backup, only entering the game when the starter was injured. In Week 15 of this season, he made his first start, throwing for 329 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-20 win over the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>The Washington Redskins beat the odds and won the NFC East. When Griffin got injured, Cousins was forced to step in again, but he only completed three of ten passes as the Seahawks defeated him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kirk-cousins-in-washington.jpg><p>Cousins’ Washington fell apart in his sophomore season, going from NFC East champions to 3-13 and last place. Cousins was once again the backup quarterback for Griffin.</p><p>Still, he was allowed to start the last three games after head coach Mike Shanahan chose to sideline Griffin to avoid injury.</p><p>Cousins was the backup quarterback again in 2014, and he took over when Griffin was injured. In the middle of the season, he participated in six games, starting five of them.</p><p>Cousins had some highs throughout this stretch of games, but he also had some lows.</p><h3>Minnesota</h3><p>Washington was still unwilling to give Kirk Cousins a multi-year deal, opting instead to trade for Alex Smith. Cousins, on the other hand, had a market, which culminated in a historic deal.</p><p>Cousins inked a three-year, $84 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings after the 2017 season, which was fully guaranteed. A fully guaranteed contract was handed to a free agent for the first time in NFL free agency history.</p><p>The 2018 Vikings had great expectations, given they were a club that had made the NFC title game the year before, kept much of their core, and upgraded their quarterback. The team, on the other hand, was inconsistent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kirk-cousins-in-minnesota.jpg><p>For the second time in his career, Cousins was allowed to start a playoff game, this time against a much-favored Saints squad on the road. However, both Cousins and the Viking’s defense performed admirably.</p><p>The Saints knotted the game at 20-20 with a last-second field goal, forcing overtime.</p><p>Minnesota received the ball first, and Cousins started throwing arguably his two most important passes of his career: a 43-yard touchdown pass to Adam Thielen that put the Vikings in the red zone.</p><p>Also, a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph sealed the Vikings’ victory and his first-ever playoff victory.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Kirk’s salary and contract income account for the majority of his earnings. Without question, the NFL pays him well enough for him to enjoy a luxury lifestyle. However, being a top NFL player comes with lucrative endorsement opportunities that are difficult to pass up.</p><p>Bose and Nike are two of his most well-known endorsement partnerships. Kirk, on the other hand, is a supporter of a few smaller businesses.</p><p>On the other hand, Kirk Cousins made a stunning $29.8 million in brand partnerships and endorsements.</p><p>According to reports, Kirk gets at least $2 million a year from his brand deals and endorsements. Cousins also makes money by selling merch and other merchandise.</p><p>In the age of social media, a person’s brand value is determined by their social media participation, and Kirk is no exception.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Despite his busy schedule, Cousins has managed to write two books so far. Firstly, Kirk released <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Game Changer</strong></a> in 2014, which is available on Amazon for $4.69.</p><p>Meet Kirk Cousins, the record-setting quarterback from Michigan State University and 2012 draft pick of the Washington Redskins.</p><p>Cousins gives readers an inside peek into his life—as seen through the lens of collegiate and professional football—and how he lives out his religion and principles both on and off the field in Game Changer.</p><p>Personal stories and tribulations of a competitive Christian athlete are featured.

This book urges young readers and fans to keep a good attitude and enjoy each victory in life.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>The Washington Redskins chose Cousins seventh in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, ranking him the 102nd overall pick.</p><p>Cousins was selected as the starting quarterback for the 2015 season over Robert Griffin III.</p><p>Cousins led a 90-yard game-winning drive against the Philadelphia Eagles on October 4, his first since 2012, to win the game 23–20.

Cousins had 425 passing yards against the Green Bay Packers the next week.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Kirk Cousins is not only a good football quarterback but also a wonderful person.
