Just because you decided to become a parent doesn’t mean you have to live in a fog until your kids grow up.</p><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">When to get your fatigue checked out</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">How can you tell when you’re experiencing something more than the typical parenting-induced sleep deprivation?&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rudder suggests seeking out help as soon as you start to question whether there might be something else going on. “Having a low threshold to reach out to someone is a good idea,” she says. “It can be hard to admit that you’re tired, but I think it’s good to talk it through with someone else who can ask more probing questions so that you get to underlying root causes.” If the first provider you see dismisses your fatigue as just a typical part of motherhood, get a second opinion.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rudder says two red flags are 1. if you’re far more tired than usual (without significant life changes that would explain the additional fatigue) and 2. if you’re experiencing other concerning symptoms along with exhaustion, like shortness of breath, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>leg swelling,</a> morning headaches, feeling extra hot or cold, or GI issues like constipation or diarrhea. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Stephanie Liu,</a> an assistant clinical professor in the department of family medicine at the University of Alberta, adds that fever, chest pain, or vision changes in addition to fatigue all warrant a visit to your doctor. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1528522981-2-2.jpg alt="Shawn Johnson" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Shawn Johnson Goes To Great Lengths To Have Her Kids Sleep When Traveling & Followers Say There’s an Easier Way</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Worst-case scenarios like cancer or occult infections are uncommon, but not unheard-of. It’s not worth missing those diagnoses&nbsp;just because you’re not sure that your fatigue is worthy of professional help.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">Reasons you might have no energy</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, here are a few of the most common explanations for why you might constantly be feeling lethargic, even if you’re getting decent sleep.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>You’re burned out</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Ongoing research</a> suggests up to 14 percent of parents experience <a href=#>burnout</a>—when you’re not just fatigued, but emotionally spent, and even a good night’s rest doesn’t help you feel refreshed. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Morgan Cutlip</a>, author of Love Your Kids Without Losing Yourself, says that burnout includes cognitive issues like forgetfulness (or an intense version of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mom brain</a>”), and emotional dysregulation, which could mean losing your cool more often. There might also be a tendency to escape into distractions like shopping, social media, or drinking. “What makes it hard to distinguish between burnout and normal motherhood stuff is that a lot of these are things we’ve normalized in motherhood,” Cutlip says. But if it’s constant, it’s a problem, she warns.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Among moms, this is sometimes called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">depleted mother syndrome</a>. “It’s when our batteries are depleted,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elizabeth Meyer,</a> a clinical social worker in Massachusetts. “There’s nothing left to give, but then we still have to give more.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>You’re struggling with a sleep disorder</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Even if your kids are sleeping through the night, you might not be. Rudder says sleep apnea in particular is becoming more common among younger patients. This happens when your airflow stops periodically while you’re asleep, and you end up waking up in the morning still feeling exhausted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Your thyroid is out of whack</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rudder says both <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism</a> can cause fatigue. That’s because the thyroid is responsible for releasing hormones into your bloodstream that regulate all kinds of bodily functions, and when it doesn’t do that appropriately, it can affect your energy levels.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>You’re low in iron&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think a lot about anemia in this population, especially if the patient is still menstruating,” Rudder says. Even if you’re not anemic, low iron levels can still cause fatigue. Particularly during the early postpartum period, Liu suggests watching how many pads you’re going through. “If you are bleeding through more than one pad an hour or passing blood clots larger than the size of an egg, low iron from bleeding can be a cause of fatigue,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>You’re experiencing post-viral fatigue</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If you’ve recently been sick, your body might still be recovering even though you otherwise feel better. Doctors often see patients struggle with lingering tiredness after a viral illness. “That’s something that can persist for a while,” Rudder says.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>You have a mood disorder&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Both <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>anxiety</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>depression</a> can manifest as fatigue. “It can be one of the initial presenting symptoms,” Rudder says. Particularly during the postpartum phase when hormones rapidly drop, keep an eye out for low mood, lack of appetite or interest, or trouble bonding with your baby, Liu warns.</p><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l">How to get your energy back</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Even if there’s nothing medical going on that’s causing your fatigue, feeling drained on a daily basis is no way to live. Not only does it simply make, well, everything feel harder, Liu points out that it can affect how we connect with those closest to us. “It can strain relationships with partners, family members, and friends, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness,” she says. It can even make it harder to bond with and care for our children.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although women are conditioned to give their all to their families — especially their kids — looking after your own health through small daily habits can go a long way to protect your energy: “Eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, go for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>walks outside</a> — exposure to natural light and physical activity is beneficial,” Liu says.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cutlip recommends giving yourself “microdoses” of self-care, fitting it into your life in ways that work for you. “We have to learn how to mother ourselves like we mother our kids,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And don’t be afraid to delegate. “Women are socialized to give and care for others. And we haven’t done a lot of teaching about how to recognize your own signals for overwhelm,” Meyer says. She suggests figuring out what fills up your own cup, then asking for the help you need to make it happen, whether that’s having your partner take care of the morning routine so you can sleep in sometimes, or having family members or a babysitter watch the kids so you can have a night out. Remember, she says, “it’s okay to have needs.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Before you go, shop our favorite sleep tools:</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sleep-products.jpg alt=sleep-products-embed width=640 height=360 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqGcmqSknXqiusNmrp6knKOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsrR7kXJwaW9ibHy4tNhmmKZlmWLAsHnToqmenF2jvG6xzZ6poLFdoryuv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
