An American woman, she was born in Roseville, a city in Minnesota to a father identified as Bruce Hasselberg and a famous mother called Loni Anderson. According to reports, her father was a school administrator. Her mother is an actress who made waves in the ’70s through the ’90s.</p><p>Sadly for Deidra Hoffman, her parents did not stay together for too long. In 1966, about a year after she was born, Deidra’s parents divorced and went their separate ways so she stayed with her mother, Loni, who struggled to raise her alone. According to reports, Loni and her ex-husband, Bruce, married in haste because they were head-over-heels in love and didn’t think things through. They were young and things didn’t work out in the end.</p><p>After her parent’s divorce, Deidra stayed with her mother who struggled to raise her alone. This was because she was studying arts at the University of Minnesota at the time and also worked as a teacher to support herself. Soon, things cleared up for them when she started landing roles as an actress.</p><p>People have often asked about what schools Deidra attended while growing up, however, this information has remained concealed at the moment. This is because she and her mother have remained silent about it. It is believed however that she has had some formal education over the years considering the home she is coming from.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=deidra-hoffman-is-married-with-kids></span><strong>Deidra Hoffman is married with kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Deidra Hoffman is currently a married woman.
