Following an affair with prominent Chinese politician Bo Xilai, Zhang Weijie, a well-known and stunning Chinese journalist, vanished from sight in 1998.

But there’s still a lot of interest in her.</p><p>These are all of the woman’s recognized characteristics.</p><h2>Zhang Weijie’s Age and Wikipedia Page</h2><p>Chinese journalist and television broadcaster Zhang Weijie was born. Her reported romance with former Chinese leader Bo Xilai garnered her a great deal of media and public attention.</p><p>When Zhang Weijie vanished, she was in her late 20s. At the same time, she was eight months pregnant.</p><p>The New York Post said that the ex-politician had one hundred mistresses.</p><p>His favorite, however, was Zhang Weijie, a TV personality who vanished in the midst of a murder and corruption scandal that rocked China’s ruling class.</p><p>According to reports, Zhang Weijie was a regular on a state-run television station in Dalian, the city where Bo Xilai held the office of mayor from 1985 to 2004.</p><p>The controversy was the poisoning death of British citizen Neil Heywood, a father of two, who may have been slain over a business disagreement with Gu Kailai, the formidable lawyer and businesswoman who was Bo Xilai’s wife.</p><p>Bo Xilai’s office was in Dalian, where Zhang Weijie was employed. The politician was not blind to the journalist’s attractiveness.</p><h2>Zhang Weijie Absence: 2024 Update</h2><p>The case of the missing journalist has not been updated. Zhang Weijie verified the reports of her involvement with the politician shortly before her disappearance.</p><p>The TV star said that she was eight months pregnant and that her connection with Bo Xilai was the source of the child’s conception.</p><p>Both the general public and the CCP ranks were deeply divided by the declaration. It was said that the mayor’s wife responded quickly.</p><p>Vision Times West claims that Gu Kailai instructed public security officers to put pressure on the journalist to retire after using her power to malign her in the local media.</p><p>Security officers said that the journalist attempted suicide many times in 1998 while being held in secret at the Dalian Nanshan Hotel. Zhang Weijie was never seen again after that.</p><p>Though none of the ideas explaining what happened to her have been proven, there are plenty.</p><p>The TV hostess was bought off by Bo Xilai’s pal Xu Ming. According to the second idea, either Bo Xilai or his wife Gu Kailai murdered her.</p><p>In a similar vein, the third idea argues that Zhang Weijie served as a model for humans for Dr. Gunter von Hagens’ controversial Body Worlds exhibition, which included plastinated corpses.</p><p>In 2012, her body was purportedly on exhibit in the US as that of a pregnant lady carrying her child in her womb.</p><p>Additionally, it is thought that Dr. Hagens obtained the bodies for his show from convicts, particularly Falun Gong practitioners.</p><p>Bo Xilai was well-known for being a Falun Gong persecutor; he authorized Dr. Hagens’ factory and awarded him honorary citizenship.</p><p>None of these views, however, is supported by any solid evidence. Zhang Weijie’s destiny is thus still unknown to this day.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Tom Stenberg, Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy, and Morgane Stapleton."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":56}{"1":62,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":79}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/tom-stenberg/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cyrus-michael-christopher-dancy/"}{"1":56}{"1":62,"2":"https://popularbio.com/morgane-stapleton/"}{"1":79}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Chinese politician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Justine Lupe From Luckiest Girl Alive | Age, Boyfriend And Salary</a></h3>Justine Lupe plays a recurring character in the American mystery suspense film Luckiest Girl Alive, which is based on a screenplay by Jessica Knoll of the same name and stars Mila Kunis and Finn Wittr <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Gavi Is The One For Princess Leonor Of Asturias | Relationship History</a></h3>The oldest daughter of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia and presumed successor to the Spanish throne is Leonor, Princess of Asturias.Countess of Cervera, Lady of Balaguer, Duchess of Montblanc, Pr <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Does Zion Clark Have A Son | Wife And Family</a></h3>Zion Clark is only one of many public personalities whose personal lives pique people's interest.
