Starring Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans, the film follows two thieves, Ridley Freeborn and Snails, as they get tangled in a conflict between the good Empress Savina and the evil mage Profion. This leads to both sides racing to wield the legendary Rod of Savrille, an item that can control Red Dragons.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>This film received a sequel in 2005, titled&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God.&nbsp;However, as the first film was a box-office failure, this installment debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel with only a limited theatrical release in some areas. Set 100 years after the first film, it follows warrior Berek (Mark Dymond) and sorceress Melora (Clemency Burton-Hill) as they try to stop the evil Damodar before he can awaken a sleeping dragon god.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>The third film in this trilogy,&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons 3: The Book of Vile Darkness,&nbsp;hit screens in 2012. Unlike the second film, this movie was a direct-to-DVD installment. It follows a young paladin called Grayson (Jack Derges) as he teams up with Akordia (Eleanor Gecks), a Shadar-kai sorceress; Seith (Lex Daniels), a human assassin; Vimak (Habib Nasib Nader), a Goliath barbarian; and Bezz (Barry Aird), a human Vermin Lord to track down the titular evil book and destroy it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Honor Among Thieves&nbsp;is the latest movie based on&nbsp;Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp;However, despite being based on the same source material as the previous films, it is a reboot of the franchise and is thus unlinked to the previous ones.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie’s official synopsis</a> describes the film by saying:&nbsp;</p><p>“A charming thief and a band of unlikely adventurers undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic, but things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves brings the rich world and playful spirit of the legendary roleplaying game to the big screen in a hilarious and action-packed adventure.”</p><h2 id=h-what-order-should-you-watch-the-dungeons-and-dragons-movies-in data-injectable=false>What order should you watch the&nbsp;Dungeons and Dragons&nbsp;movies in?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Thankfully, the watch order for the&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;films is easy to follow. The first three films can be watched in the order they came out.&nbsp;</p><li>Dungeons & Dragons</li><li>Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God</li><li>Dungeons & Dragons 3: The Book of Vile Darkness</li><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Because&nbsp;Honor Among Thieves&nbsp;is a reboot, you can watch it whenever you please, as it is not linked to the previous movies. In fact, based on early information about the film, it seems like the writers have gone out of their way to make the story accessible to those new to the franchise, meaning you’ll need little to no foreknowledge to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-d-d-films-that-aren-t-d-d-films data-injectable=false>The D&D films that aren’t D&D films</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>One reason many people get confused about the&nbsp;Dungeons and Dragons&nbsp;movie watch order is that there are a few movies that, while based on the gameplay or lore of&nbsp;Dungeons and Dragons,&nbsp;were not officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast, meaning they are not official&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>This includes the infamous 1982 film&nbsp;Mazes and Monsters.&nbsp;This movie follows a group of young people (one of whom is played by a young Tom Hanks) obsessed with their favorite roleplaying game. When the group embarks on a spelunking trip, they all suddenly believe they are their in-game characters, leading to their suffering horrible fates. Obviously, due to the movie’s heavy anti-D&D&nbsp;stance, it wasn’t approved by the game’s publishers and thus isn’t an official product, despite frequently getting confused for one.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>There is also the 2008 animated movie&nbsp;Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight. While set in the classic&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;campaign setting Dragonlance, it is an adaptation of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman’s novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight,&nbsp;meaning it isn’t considered a true&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;movie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=false>There was also&nbsp;Scourge of Worlds: A Dungeons & Dragons Adventure.&nbsp;This 2003 direct-to-DVD computer-animated movie stood out due to its interactive elements; viewers could make choices as they watched the film, and these choices would shape the plot. However, due to this element, the game isn’t counted in the official line of&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;films, being marketed instead as a new way to enjoy the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZZGhuW6w1KeenqeeqHqlvsCgpqerXaK8t7XErGSipl2kv6Wx0Wagp5ucqrGqusZmm66ml5q8r7%2BMnaman5%2BjwG60zqemq2WRoryvs4ytn6KdpprAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
