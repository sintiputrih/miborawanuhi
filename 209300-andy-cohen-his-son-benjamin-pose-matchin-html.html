"I've hosted reunions for years, but yesterday's was the best one yet," he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-coronavirus-reunited-with-son-ben-photo/>said</a> at the time.</p><p class=Zg>Soon enough, Ben might have a playmate around his own age.

Responding to a comment made on Instagram, Cohen <a class="zd d" href=#>approved</a> the suggestion that Ben and Wyatt would be best friends.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Andy Cohen giving a thumbs up on his Instagram Story | Photo: Instagram/@andycohen</p><p class=Zg>Before that, Cohen had commented underneath Cooper's post announcing the new members of his family.

Furthermore, gay men have to abstain from sex for three months before donations.</p><p class=Zg>Cohen noted that no such rules existed for straight individuals, and questioned the logic applied in the protocols. He lamented the lack of adaptation as he explained that all he wanted was to save a life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtncmtgZXqiusOyZJynmJq7brTIrGSsp55ir6a6yZqkoqZdpby0sYymmK2bmJ67b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
