"He was so easy to talk to," she told&nbsp;Playboy.&nbsp;"We were both psychology majors, so we had a lot in common. It was like we already knew each other." Hefner fell head over heels for Harris, and she quickly became his No. 1 girlfriend, appearing in his magazine as Miss December 2009. A year of wining and dining followed, before Hefner popped the question. She said yes, but nerves later got the better of her, and Harris called the whole thing off just days before the ceremony</p><p>"I was overwhelmed," she told the magazine. "There were legal proceedings—a prenuptial agreement, Playmate contracts—and there were other girls. It was too much for me." It took another year for Harris to decide to finally became Crystal Hefner, marrying the entertainment icon in a private ceremony in December 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his death, Harris spoke to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;"I am heartbroken," she said.&nbsp;"He was an American hero. A pioneer. A kind and humble soul who opened up his life and home to the world. I felt how much he loved me. I loved him so much. I am so grateful." She added, "He gave me life. He gave me direction. He taught me kindness. I will feel eternally grateful to have been by his side, holding his hand, and telling him how much I love him. He changed my life, he saved my life. He made me feel loved every single day. He was a beacon to the world, a force unlike anything else."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXFha4JwtNSgn2aglZu7pr7SZp6iqpybv6qxzZ2qZqafrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
