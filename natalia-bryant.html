Unlike most of the celebrity kids, Natalia isn't so active in social medias too.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/7/custom_1581066925665-1581067011782.jpg><p>Although she has to face with medias in the public, Natalia has learned to play it safe. Currently, Natalia attends Sage Hill High School where she plays volleyball with the team <i>Sage Hill Lightning</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kobe's Demise Left Bryant Family Devastated</h2><p>Natalia's dad and baby sister Gianna were among the nine people that were <a href=#>killed in the crash</a>.

More to that, Natalia's grandparents and two aunts failed to attend the wedding ceremony. Two years later, Kobe and Vanessa welcomed their first daughter Natalia. Her birth became the sole reason for the couple's reunion with Natalia's grandparents.&nbsp;</p><h2>Natalia's Spoiled Childhood</h2><p>As the baby girl of the legendary basketball player, Natalia's childhood was no different from the life of the richest kids.
