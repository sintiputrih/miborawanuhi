The original article follows.</pre><p>Via the Bethesda support website, the publisher confirmed that "Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC in <strong>the first half of 2023</strong>." That's still a pretty big release date window for Starfield.</p><p>However, fans think they've narrowed it down to an exact date for when they can join the Constellation, aka the "last group of space explorers." Some fans are exploring what the exact date would be, and one date really does make a lot of sense: <strong>12 April 2023</strong>.</p><p>Bethesda likes meaningful release dates. For example, they wanted to release Starfield on 11/11/22. Fallout 4 was released on 10 November 2015, the 240th anniversary of the Marine Corps, one day before Veteran's Day.</p><p>So why the 12 April 2023 release date? Well, that's International Day of Human Space Flight. For those who don't know, that's the anniversary of the first time humans went to space, back in 1961! It would make a whole lot of sense for the game to release on the same day.</p><p>As for the time Starfield would release, this remains much more unclear. We do suspect that Starfield will release globally at the same time, possibly at <strong>midnight on 12 April 2023</strong>. Alternatively, as Bethesda did with Fallout 4, it could release one day before the International Day of Human Space Flight, on <strong>11 April 2023</strong>.</p><h2>Starfield Launch Countdown Clock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2EJUfqUMDKKwFjX8K1azZhksKDo9fP18ZNz9UWEWmY8/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9TdGFyZmllbGQvU3RvcnlMZW5naHQvU3RhcmZpZWxkaG93bG9uZ3RvYmVhdHN0b3J5Mi5qcGc_X3Q9MTY1NTgwMDg0Nw><p>You can use it to keep track of the exact hours and days remaining before the launch of Starfield on Xbox Series X/S and PC with the countdown clock below.</p><p>126 days, 11:19:02</p><p>We will endeavor to update this article with any new information regarding Starfield's launch on PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles.
