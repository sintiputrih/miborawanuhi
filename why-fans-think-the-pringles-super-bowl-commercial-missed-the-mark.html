Fans had a difficult time deciphering what the short advertising segment was trying to say with their astronaut-abandoning theme. Twitter user&nbsp;<a href=#>@awolk</a>, for example, said he had "zero idea" what the commercial was about and asks if it was some sort of "inside joke." Another,&nbsp;<a href=#>@RichLightShed</a>,&nbsp;wrote it was a "Nice way to waste $5 mm," and several football fans hopped on the Twitter line to agree with him. Yet another viewer,&nbsp;<a href=#>@NicholsCarleigh</a>, says, "I didn't care much for the Pringles commercial. Positioning/takeaway wasn't super clear beyond their usual 'stacks.'"</p><p dir=ltr>To another, lesser-extent, a few fans, such as <a href=#>@hooplooops</a>, complained about the company's new logo, but that's not something that will usually put fans off like, say, paying for a Super Bowl ad that the viewers don't understand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkXFwcmpfrLW6ecWapaxlpJ22r7eMrZ%2BeZaCntq%2Bzy56qZqulpbKzecGorqVlk6S6rrHRnKCapF2itrS%2FxJ1kraCVYrqivspo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
