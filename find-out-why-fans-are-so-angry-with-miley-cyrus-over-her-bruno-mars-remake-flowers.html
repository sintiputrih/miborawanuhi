They announced they were engaged in 2012, but broke it off not long after, and each went their separate ways. 2015 found them back together and rekindling their romance. This time it took and <a href=#>the couple got married </a>in December of 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-divorced-in-2020><strong>Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Divorced In 2020</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Miley-Cyrus-Featured-Image.jpg><p>Liam Hemsworth filed for divorce from <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, citing "irreconcilable differences". Some fans believe that Miley's new song, Flowers,<a href=#> is about her break-up</a> with Liam, and for some reason are having a huge problem with that. When Taylor Swift does it, it's ok; why are they so hard on Miley?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Miley Cyrus Hasn't Gone On Tour In Years; Will She Tour In 2023?">Miley Cyrus Hasn't Gone On Tour In Years; Will She Tour In 2023?</a></span></p><p>Miley has lost a lot of fans over the years due to her behavior. Many people think that she is too wild and doesn't care about anyone but herself. For those not familiar, a few things Miley has done to shock the world are:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>For<a href=#> Vanity Fair's June 2008 cover</a>, Annie Leibovitz photographed then-15-year-old Cyrus in nothing but a sheet. She apologized to her fans for it, and then ten years later, Cyrus rescinded her apology. Re-sharing a New York Post cover<a href=#> via Twitter</a>, Cyrus wrote, "I'M NOT SORRY" and added, "F–k YOU."</li><li>She cyberbullied Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato</li><li>In 2009, while still starring on <a href=#>Disney's Hannah Montana</a>, she chose to do a pole dance at the Teen Choice Awards.</li><li>Bong videos, birthday cakes, drugs, and<a href=#> the twerking on Robin Thicke</a>, these are all just a few.</li></ul><h2 id=miley-cyrus-released-a-new-song-flowers><strong>Miley Cyrus Released A New Song, Flowers</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/178A9C9D-088D-4EDF-9AED-2AFA86377167.jpeg><p>Miley Cyrus has released a new song, Flowers, which this writer believes is a female version of Bruno Mars' When I Was Your Man. No, the song is not an official remake, but it shares so many similarities. It seems to have the same rhythm, for one, it just goes faster. More so, the words. Let's take a look:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Bruno: I hope he buys you flowers / Miley: I can buy myself flowers</li><li>I hope he holds your hand / I can hold my own hand</li><li>Give you all his hours / Talk to myself for hours</li><li>Take you to every party, 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance / I can take myself dancing</li><li>Do all the things I should have done, when I was your man. / Yeah, I can love me better than you can</li></ul><p>After further digging, it was found that<a href=#> Liam dedicated the Bruno</a> song to her after their first breakup, and other fans were thinking the same thing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Miley Cyrus And Other Musicians Who Gave Fans The Best Songs About Moving On">Miley Cyrus And Other Musicians Who Gave Fans The Best Songs About Moving On</a></span></p><p>Fans are not happy about it for the most part.<a href=#> Comments on Instagram</a> like, "Funny how she released the song on his birthday smh." And "He obviously moved on now she needs to as well! It's been years and she's the one who ruined that marriage tbh smh leave the guy alone!" It is true, it has been three years, but they broke up and got back together in the past, maybe the third time's a charm?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many fans are convinced that Cyrus purposely chose to <a href=#>release Flowers on Hemsworth's birthday</a> as a way to get back at him, others believe that the timing of the release was just a coincidence.</p><h2 id=at-least-miley-cyrus-never-dated-pete-davidson><strong>At Least Miley Cyrus Never Dated Pete Davidson</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pete-davidson-miley-cyrus.jpg><p>In 2021, there was speculation, but no, Miley and Pete never dated. She is nearly one of the only female celebs that can say that. She has spent the majority of her life singing and performing, and as a result, she has achieved considerable success. Regardless of whether it was her intention, Miley has committed a plethora of things throughout the years that have made her quite well-known now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the actions she took including shedding her Hannah Montana persona and taking her new appearance and attitude to the 2013 VMAs stage, were perilous for her career and her reputation. Many viewers voiced their opinions about Miley after she performed twerking. It was to the delight of few and offended others.</p><p>Miley has a good side. In addition to supporting more than 40 different organizations and charities, Miley Cyrus is a <a href=#>genuinely caring</a> and giving person. She is among the musicians who give the most to charity monetarily. The Happy Hippie Foundation is a nonprofit organization she founded to help young homeless children.</p><p>Miley identifies as bisexual; she rejects labels of any kind, whether they be sexual or gender-based. And she is a huge supporter of LGBTQ+ rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidoqaUYry2wIywn7Jllpa7tHnAq5xmq59irq%2Bz0bJksKGknXqutcuesGabqafCtHnOr5yrZZiav26u0a6lqGWdlr%2B0edGepJqjlWKzrbvWnqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
