Via an excerpt published in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, Diana and Gere took to each other immediately, which Stallone definitely did not like. The evening proceeded, but when it was time to sit down for dinner, neither Gere nor Stallone could be found. John sent his husband, David Furnish, to find them, and the situation Furnish found was far from peaceful.</p><p>"It transpired that he'd discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fist-fight,"&nbsp;John wrote. Furnish prevented the fight from happening, but the atmosphere between Stallone and Gere didn't settle. Following dinner, Gere and Diana continued to talk, and Stallone left angrily, with John sharing that the actor said, "I never would have come ... if I'd known prince f***in' Charming was gonna be here." Stallone allegedly added, 'If I'd wanted her, I would've taken her!'"&nbsp;However, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Stallone refuted this entire story.&nbsp;Responding to a fan who asked him if the tale was true on one of his 2019 Instagram posts, the actor said, "Total BS for him to sell books. Total rubbish."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k25ucmhoZMSpxYyssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z50aKaoZmimXqosdGeZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2dsqLAxJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
