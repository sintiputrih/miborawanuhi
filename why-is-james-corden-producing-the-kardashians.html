Sure, the host had long known <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and the rest of her family. They have been on his show over the years, after all. However, it wasn’t just their existing relationship that eventually landed Corden the gig.Instead, it may have been a high-profile onscreen reunion that the host worked on behind the scenes recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-corden-hosts-acts-and-produces>James Corden Hosts, Acts, And Produces</h2><p>Corden wasn’t in the business of producing from the start. In fact, it was only in 2017 that he decided to join the U.K. production outfit Fulwell 73 which was founded by Ben Winston, Ben Turner, Gabe Turner, and Leo Pearlman. At that time, the company was already making some noise in the music world, having worked with One Direction, Robbie Williams, Take That, 5 Seconds of Summer, and many others.</p><p>The team also knew Corden well as they had also been behind the Late Late Show. Not to mention, they’ve worked with the late-night host numerous times in the past, including on James Corden’s World Cup Live, When James Met Robbie, and When Corden Met Barlow. And so, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making Corden a partner was a logical next step</a> for the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“James joining as the fifth partner feels like the most natural and obvious step for all of us,” Pearlman affirmed. “He has been a good friend, key creative influence and talent we have turned to time and time again and the chance to formalise our relationship with him was a chance too good to pass up.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>LA Residents Furious With Camila Cabello & James Corden For Blocking Traffic With Flash Mob</a></span></p><p>As for Corden, the host/actor has always felt like he was part of the team. “In many ways I’ve felt like an unofficial partner for many years, and now that it’s official I feel incredibly proud to have joined this incredible company,” he remarked. “Watching Fulwell 73 have such phenomenal growth over the past decade has been inspiring to watch.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Corden had come onboard, Fulwell 73 went on to produce a Carpool Karaoke series for Apple Music, the tv special Adele One Night Only, and of course, the Emmy-nominated Friends: The Reunion.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-why-james-corden-is-producing-lsquo-the-kardashians-rsquo-today>Here’s Why James Corden Is Producing ‘The Kardashians’ Today</h2><p>Some might say that it started with a pair of Gucci pajamas. After all, Corden sent one to momager Kris Jenner after she agreed to meet with the late-night host on Zoom for a pitch. At that time, Corden learned that Jenner was meeting with various production companies for their reality show 2.0 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he just wanted a moment of her time</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I said, ‘I can’t tell you how much Ben and I appreciate the opportunity to even be in your orbit, and if nothing ever happens, it was a joy just to talk to you all,’” Corden recalled. Just like Corden, Winston was also not too optimistic. “I thought, ‘Well, nothing will come of this, but it was fun to meet all the Kardashians on a Zoom,’” he said. “That was more fun than my next meeting.”</p><p>In fact, Winston was so convinced that they weren’t going to land the project that he went to Cabo. By then, Corden and Winston have earned a much-needed break. Their Fullwell 73 had been busy with the Grammys and the Friends reunion, and they’ve just kept going since. And so, Winston was determined to take some time off with his wife.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Some Say James Corden Has Fewer Fans Than He Thinks</a></span></p><p>But then, life had other plans for Winston even when he was already in Cabo. It turns out that Jenner and her family were quite impressed with Fulwell 73. And so, Corden soon called to tell Winston that they got the gig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I had booked this unbelievable massage, and I was on my way, but I was so excited that all I could think about was, ‘Oh, my God. We’re about to take over the Kardashian show,'” Winston recalled.</p><p>Winston also believes it was their work on Friends: The Reunion that won reality TV’s most famous family over. “We knew they would bring an elevated production level to the new series, both with their storytelling and visually,” Kardashian also remarked. “We’ve had an incredible working relationship so far, and we’re excited to continue this new journey together.”</p><p>Meanwhile, aside from The Kardashians, Corden has also been hard at work on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming dramedy Mammals</a>, which he will both star in and produce.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>James Corden Shares The Memory Of His Most Awkward Moment With Paparazzi</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsButsCmnKxlk6S%2FpbHNZqerp5SqsKq6xmaroZ1doK6zsMCsn6KZnqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
