In reaction to the loud jet engines, he adorably covered his ears, and when it was all over, he excitedly threw both fists up in the air.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, at various points during the celebration, Louis didn't hide his boredom, cradling his chin in his hands, tapping his hands on the balcony's railing, and turning to chat with his parents Kate Middleton and Prince William. The young royal did, however, surprise on-lookers with an act of maturity when he ended his appearance with a salute to the crowd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And with that, ladies and gentlemen, the king of the funny royal photo-op has left the building.
