In 2018, after she was fired by another salon, she created <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slay Bae,</a> which became a business that allowed Gina to not only make a solid living but also hire apprentices under her.</p><p>She went from renting a salon suite in another facility to being in a position to have other stylists rent out suites from her.</p><p>Gina also has plans to develop her own line of hair extensions that she wants to teach other stylists about when the time comes.

"For me, the sky's the limit. I'll always be growing and that is just in my nature.

And, she explained to us, "relationships do not come easy" to her, which is where her "natural" hesitation lies.</p><p>"This was the first boyfriend that I really saw a future with," she said, of her last relationship that ended a few years before she joined MAFS. "We had openly discussed marriage, family, and we were madly in love. We both worked in the bars downtown, him playing music and me bartending. I didn't support the party lifestyle, and he didn't want to give it up. So in a sense, I felt like he chose that over me and it broke my spirit."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, after some soul searching and after Gina took the time to focus on herself, she figured out how to fall in love again.
