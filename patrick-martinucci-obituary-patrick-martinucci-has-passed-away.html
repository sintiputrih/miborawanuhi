After a courageous four-year battle with cancer, he died peacefully at home with his beloved family. Arthur R. and Helen Ann (McLaughlin) Martinucci were surprised by Patrick’s midlife birth. He was supposed to be christened Vincent Rafael, but his red hair changed everything. After he came on Aug. 16, 1976, his mother selected Patrick Michael, her favorite saint and archangel. At Patrick’s baptism, Fr. Daly remarked he wouldn’t have named him otherwise.</p><p>Pat’s father liked 1970s home videos, which needed bright light. Pat was fair enough to glow, but the camera couldn’t capture his features. Big sister Tammy lavished Pat with love and carried him until he was too heavy to lift. Even after Pat accidentally smacked him with a hoe, older brother Artie was often blamed for Patrick’s trouble. Patrick cried after hurting his larger brother, and their dad shouted “Artie!” to show who was to fault for stepping in the way. Patrick was talented from childhood. Danced, played piano, and competed in soccer, tennis, and baseball. Patrick’s sweeper skills and tenacity helped Erie Cathedral Prep win several games.</p><p>Patrick played soccer for Allegheny College. He received his DO from The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine after graduating from Allegheny with a BS in Chemistry. Pat got the 2005-2006 Professionalism Award for best demonstrating medical professionalism during his Internal Medicine Residency at The Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. Nephrology fellowship at State University of New York in Buffalo followed. He joined The Kidney Group in 2008 and became a partner. His coworkers at The Kidney Group remember his witty sense of humor, boundless concern for patients, and relationship with staff and strangers. Patrick was Northeast Ohio Medical University Assistant Internal Medicine Professor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKiRqb%2Bqr8pmpJqqpJ67tq%2FComSompmpwqK%2B2GanmqyinrCsecyaqa2hnqqwpLWMoZisZaCWwLSxw2aYsJmpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
