It would help to know what Twitter said they weren‚Äôt doing and what it is that they are doing. Besides that, it would also be good to know what proof the Let There Be Light star is talking about.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everything we knew Twitter was doing that Twitter said they weren't doing and that we didn't have proof Twitter was doing even though we knew Twitter was doing‚Ä¶ Twitter was in fact doing and we now have proof.</p>‚Äî Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) <a href=#>December 9, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Sorbo seems to be stepping further into the dung pile tweet after tweet. He came under fire not too long ago when he tweeted about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">memorial in the Black Hills region</a>, ‚ÄúEver wonder why there are no democrats on Mount Rushmore?‚Äù For that, twits from all walks of life took him to the cleaners.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>In another tweet in which he drew ire, the actor comes across as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a free healthcare advocate anti-vaxxer</a>, ‚ÄúIf the shots were given away for free because they‚Äôre life-saving, why isn‚Äôt insulin free? Chemotherapy? Epipens?‚Äù In an even more confusing tweet, Sorbos came across as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-police</a> when he tweeted, ‚ÄúDisband the FBI.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Which side he stands on is often confusing, but this most recent tweet beats them all. It‚Äôs a ball of confusion all wrapped up in nonsense and tied off in a bow of shenanigans, the response to which seems to be half of Twitter having fun.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5KtADcK6a5</a></p>‚Äî Bernard Sullivan (@bernardsull) <a href=#>December 9, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>It feels good to know that there are others out there who have no idea what this rambling means, either. It‚Äôs challenging to read something that makes no sense, and see other people agreeing with it. That‚Äôs when life gets hard and a vacation sounds real good.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yeah, what u said.</p>‚Äî john briggs (@johnbri85749318) <a href=#>December 9, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>One fan is concerned. What kind of intervention would Sorbo need? A dose of reality intervention, or more like a substance abuse intervention?
