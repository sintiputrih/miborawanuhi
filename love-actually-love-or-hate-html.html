In movies beautiful people always fall in love with other beautiful people! What’s wrong with love at first sight, anyway? Which are both fair responses, as far as they go. But <i>Love Actually</i> is a considerable outlier among romantic comedies in its rigorous conviction not only that people fall in love without really knowing one another, but that they don’t even need to learn anything about each other to confirm their initial attraction.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04426feb10c102ac8d78d5b4ca7338ea-5-0-0@published data-word-count=70><span>So not only does Orr think <i>Love Actually</i> is not a good holiday film (“Insofar as </span>Love Actually<span> conveys the spirit of any holiday, that holiday is Valentine’s Day — and, indeed, the film served as a model for a few ensemble romantic comedies (</span><span><i>He’s Just Not That Into You</i></span><span>, </span><span><i>Valentine’s Day</i></span><span>) that have since been associated with that date”), it’s not a good rom-com either. And he’s not alone!</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I put white lights on my Christmas tree and I think Love, Actually is a bad movie.

It does not have the structure required of the genre. To be honest, if you’re going to compare it to any one film you should probably compare it to Crash, the working title of which I’d like to think was Racism, Actually. If the theme of Crash is “We’re all at least a little bit racist deep inside” the theme of <i>Love Actually</i> is “We’re all a little crazily romantic deep inside.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04426feb10c102ac8d78d5b4ca7338ea-10-0-0@published data-word-count=81><span>If you’re comparing <i>Love Actually</i> to other rom-coms (<a href=#>whoops!</a>), you’ve got it all wrong, he says, contending that<i> Love Actually</i> is about “thinking you’re in love”: “Almost all of the stories center around people who either early on, or before the film even begins, figure out they’re nuts about someone and then spend the five weeks before Christmas wondering, ‘What do I do now?’” Which makes sense if you’re thinking of it as a tragic story, like </span><a href=#><span>Think Progress’s Alyssa Rosenberg</span></a><span>:</span></p><p><span>The point of Sarah’s story isn’t that having a mentally ill relative condemns a woman “to an early spinsterhood,” as Orr puts it. Rather, the problem is Sarah’s feeling of obligation to her brother (and the movie takes care to note how accommodating Harry, her boss, is of the calls), separate from her actual day-to-day responsibilities for his care. She’s displaced all of her emotional energy and ambitions for herself onto her brother. Sarah isn’t neglected or overlooked. She’s a tragic figure, and one of her own making.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04426feb10c102ac8d78d5b4ca7338ea-12-0-0@published data-word-count=35><span>Perhaps it doesn’t matter whether Love Actually is “good” or “bad,” just that it’s become part of a Christmastime ritual (whether you like it or not!). </span><a href=#><span>Anne Helen Petersen at the L.A. Book Review explains:</span></a></p><p><span><span>In order for a film to become ritualized, however, it must hew to the ideological formula. It can be a little postmodern splintered, like </span>Love Actually<span>, or be filtered through the lens of comedy, like </span>National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation<span>, but it must also work to vivify the understanding of Christmas as about family and love, as opposed to its historic ideological engine (Christ) or its contemporary one (Capital)…To be clear, I like Christmas movies. Who doesn’t like ideological closure! It is preposterously reassuring! But “liking” something, and reveling in the comfort and joy that washes over me for 120 minutes before I return to the beloved catastrophe of my own family Christmases, is a very different thing than claiming a Christmas movie as “good.” I </span><span>love</span><span> the haze of just too much cheap champagne; that doesn’t mean I recognize it, or would tell anyone else, that it’s </span><span>good</span><span>.</span><br></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04426feb10c102ac8d78d5b4ca7338ea-14-0-0@published data-word-count=45>Good, bad, happy, sad — whatever you think<i> Love Actually</i> is, let’s give it credit for being such a wonderful lightning rod this holiday season.
