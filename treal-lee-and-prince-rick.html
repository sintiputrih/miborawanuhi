The chorus repeats the phrase "walk around the club, fuck everybody" several times, emphasizing the idea of being detached from the world around them. The verses contain various references to fighting, not giving a fuck, and being too drunk or high to function properly. The song seems to be about losing oneself in the party scene and embracing a carefree attitude.</p><br><p>The opening lines of the song are particularly noteworthy as they set the tone for the rest of the lyrics. "Walk around the club, fuck everybody" is a bold statement that conveys a sense of rebellion and disregard for societal norms. The following lines, "Can't see, can't walk, fuck everybody," suggest that the singers are under the influence of drugs or alcohol and unable to fully engage with the world around them. This theme is echoed throughout the song as the singers repeat variations of the phrase "I'm in my own zone" and describe their lack of concern for anyone else.</p><br><p>Overall, the lyrics to Walk Around The Club paint a picture of a wild and reckless party scene that is both liberating and dangerous. The singers seem to be having the time of their lives, but also acknowledge the potential consequences of their actions.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line

throwed off</u><br>Someone, possibly a love interest or drug dealer, has disrupted my state of mind.</p><br><p><u>Hey, you better leave me alone (better leave me alone)</u><br>I'm warning others not

don't need that bitch (bitch), f- everybody (huh)</u><br>I don't think anyone needs their partner or anyone else in the club and should just focus on themselves.</p><br><p><u>You a scary nigga (nigga), you scared everybody (huh)</u><br>I believe some people are weak or easily intimidated and are therefore not worth my time.</p><br><p><u>If she a scary bitch (bitch), she scared of everybody</u><br>I believe a woman who is easily scared is not worth pursuing sexually or romantically.</p><br><p><u>It's Treal Lee nigga (nigga), Triple D nigga (nigga)</u><br>The rappers' names are Treal Lee and Prince Rick, and they represent the Triple D area of Dallas, Texas.</p><br><p><u>Ain′t shit about my city you can tell me nigga (huh)</u><br>The rappers are heavily connected to their hometown and know everything there is to know about it.</p><br><p><u>Bitch I'm the shit you can smell me nigga (ah-ha)</u><br>The rappers are confident in their abilities and don't care if anyone else disagrees.</p><br><p><u>Ain′t nothing in these streets you can sell me nigga (sell me nigga)</u><br>The rappers have already experienced everything the streets have to offer and cannot be sold on any experience or product.</p><br><p><u>She took me to the bed, I don't know what we did</u><br>The rappers had a sexual encounter but are unsure what happened due to alcohol or drug use.</p><br><p><u>All I remember is she tried to swallow all my kids</u><br>The rappers recall the woman they slept with performing oral sex on them.</p><br><p><u>And you (and you) and you (and you)</u><br>The rappers are directing their anger towards multiple individuals, not just one.</p><br><p><u>Nigga if you ain't sippin′ then nigga fuck you (fuck you)</u><br>The rappers believe if someone is not drinking alcohol at the club, then they are not worth their time.</p><br><p><u>You know status stay pimpin′ then that's what I do (I do)</u><br>The rappers pride themselves on their player lifestyle and believe it's the only way to live.</p><br><p><u>Get her tipsy then I make her sell skin like balloon</u><br>The rappers believe they can manipulate a drunk woman into having sex with them.</p><br><p><u>Man I′m all the way loud</u><br>The rappers are very vocal about their beliefs and attitudes towards others.</p><br><p><u>(He got me throwed off)</u><br>This phrase is repeated multiple times, possibly indicating the disruptive influence of someone else on the rappers' night.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Miles B.
