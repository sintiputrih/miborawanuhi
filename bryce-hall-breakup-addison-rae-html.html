He&nbsp;allegedly had physical relations in Vegas with an adult film star, who tried to extort him for $75,000. Instead of paying her, Hall dismissed her and told her to do whatever she wanted.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the story spread; some people believed it, and some did not.&nbsp;Rae did not believe it as well, but netizens started attacking her for dating a “cheater,” and it was affecting her work.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the light of such a scenario, Hall and Rae decided to breakup mutually.

Does she really need her EX bringing up her name every chance he gets? She’s moved on, let her be happy with Omer,” commented a user.&nbsp;</p><p>The user added they were suspicious of Hall genuinely having difficulty moving on or using Rae&nbsp;to stay relevant. “Why is everyone absolutely ignoring the fact this man obsessively talks about his ex all the time,” wrote another user.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But some users defended Hall, saying that people kept trying to make him talk about Rae.&nbsp;</p><p>“Y’all acting like ‘why he is talking about her’ when clearly other are the ones are asking questions about her to him or bringing up her name so he can talk,” a user defended Hall. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqirrCmeceao6VlkqeyorfUqWSanJSewLC6jKuYnmaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
