As hard as it was for the fans to digest, it was even harder for the cast. Even know watching it back, the six friends <a href=#>aren't quite sure how they were able to get through it.</a></p><p>"There was a lot of crying that night," says LeBlanc, "I don't know how we got through actual scenes," Kudrow would also add in.</p><p>Co-creator Marta Kauffman would also add the fact that it wasn't just the end of the show, but it was the end of a ten-year relationship, which is what made everything that much harder.</p><p>"It was not just the end of a series, it was the end of 10 years of relationships. I mean we were really proud of this show, but like anything good we were sad when it was over. This was no longer that time in your life when your friends are your family. You're starting your own family. You don't want them to feel like, "Thank God it's over!" And leaving them wanting more is always a nice thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span></p><p>Throughout its history, the show released 236 episodes in its ten seasons. Given such longevity, things were bound to go off the rails at times and not make sense. Turns out, from a production standpoint, fans caught several of these moments, including in the final episode.</p><h2 id=it-wasn-39-t-the-only-time-39-friends-39-fans-caught-an-error-on-the-show>It Wasn't The Only Time 'Friends' Fans Caught An Error On The Show</h2><p>Credit to Express,<a href=#>who shared some faulty moments that took place on 'Friends'</a>. To the casual fan, chances are you really hadn't noticed these moments - however, for the hardcore fans, it is really hard to get anything passed them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That includes fillers stepping in for Monica and Rachel, although the camera wasn't pointed directly at them, fans were still able to catch others in their place. Heck, at one point, Rachel's stand-in is even caught wearing a different shirt than she was originally wearing in the Thanksgiving episode!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Think Matt LeBlanc Would've Been Kicked Off 'Friends' Had He Done This To Jennifer Aniston Today</a></span></p><p>Other blunders included Joey switching clothes while he was at Ross' apartment - likely because the episode underwent a reshoot and Joey's original clothes were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Fans would also catch Monica wanting to open a box from their wedding, only for the same box to be wrapped just moments later...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even during the very last episode in season 10, a fan noticed a certain extra appearing in multiple scenes.

However, it seems like some fans had their attention in other areas, looking at the extras who appeared at the airport.</p><p>Let's rewind shall we, Ross ends up going to JFK alongside Phoebe, only to realize that he was at the wrong airport the entire time. At the point, a woman with a headband can be spotted in the background.</p><p>Once Ross and Phoebe head to Newark airport, once again, the same woman with a headband is visible in the background while Ross is at Rachel's gate... did the production crew get lazy... or did this woman end up arriving at the wrong airport as well like Ross and Phoebe?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/friends-airport-scene.png><p>Props to 'Friends' fans for pointing this out - at the very least, maybe the extra could've undergone a wardrobe change. Though in truth, the cast and crew likely had their heads somewhere else, given that it was the final episode of the iconic sitcom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Completely Lost It When Matt LeBlanc Messed Up His Line On 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecWipZqklWKyucDRmqpmpZmowaK3xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
