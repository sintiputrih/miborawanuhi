I knew it was wrong.”</p><p>She said she struggled to tell her family about her actions and had abused her position of authority.</p><p>“The lines became blurred and there was a lack of judgment that led to these serious offences,” Young said.</p><p>Her barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, said the change in teaching had “allowed a blurring, a criminal blurring undoubtedly” of Young’s role, and she had “only really wanted to give extra help” to the boy.</p><p>“It got out of hand, and criminally so, in a very clear breach of trust not only to the boy but … to the community,” Ms Cunneen said. “And she is very aware of that now.”</p><p>Ms Cunneen asked Young not be given a “crushing sentence” but rather very close supervision when she leaves custody, so she can continue to receive psychological help.</p><p>Noting it “may sound like a sexist submission”, the barrister said she was not trying to excuse Young’s behaviour but suggested male child sexual assault offenders “generally” seek out employment to access the people at the centre of their fetishes or fantasies.</p><p>“That’s really just not the case with this young woman,” Ms Cunneen said.</p><p>But Mr Terracini submitted Young “knew precisely what was going on” and had made comments to the effect of “it’s dangerous if we get caught but if you do it, it’ll be worth it”.</p><p>The prosecutor said this was not “spontaneous” abuse and the behaviour came to a halt, “not voluntarily”, after the boy’s family members had noticed Young in a car park and told his mother.</p><p>The prosecutor said it may be unusual that female teachers come before the court having abused a male student but Young chose to work at that school and chose to sexually abuse one of the boys.</p><p>“Perhaps I’m showing modern flavour, but how on earth is gender relevant in this? The Crimes Act doesn’t care if it’s a man or a woman … it’s the abuse, that’s why we’re here … it’s why she has to go to jail.”</p><p>Young, who remains on bail, is due to be sentenced on July 8.</p><p><b><i>The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. </i></b><b><i>Sign up <a href=#>here</a></i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno66xr7HYZquemZOdsrN5xZqanqtdn66quIytoKadXZaztbHRZqqesKWWuW6twa6qnmWfm3pygIyynJqqXaS5pXnBqLBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
