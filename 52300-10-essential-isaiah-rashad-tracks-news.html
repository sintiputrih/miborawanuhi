The couplet "And 'no' is kinda hard to say to drugs /&nbsp;I been having problems with myself" foreshadows the Xanax and alcohol dependency he would develop in 2014.</p><p><h2>"Webbie Flow (U Like)"</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Rashad is constantly paying tribute to his Southern rap forebearers. "Webbie Flow" is an homage to the Louisiana rapper Webbie. Rashad's extra-horny raps, overlaid atop a smoky, reggae-inflected Mr. Carmack beat, set the tone for the rest of&nbsp;<strong>Cilvia Demo.</strong></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>The two verses of "Ronnie Drake," named after one of Rashad's friends from home, are different in temperament but act as two sides of the same coin. The song is about race, and the first verse is passionate, fiery, the black man's rage, while the second verse is broader, more reflective and incisive.</p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Rashad is often compared to his labelmate <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> for his soulful, cerebral style. On "Shot You Down," he employs a technique also used by Kendrick in which he makes sentences grammatically incorrect so that they rhyme: "I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at? Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at."</p><p><h2>"R.I.P. Kevin Miller"</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Though "R.I.P. Kevin Miller" never directly references Kevin Miller, Master P and Silkk the Shocker's brother who was murdered in 1990, it is an ode to everything Kevin Miller represents: Southern rap of a bygone era. Rashad holding the torch.</p><p>"I need diamond teeth, living like it's 1998<br>Like when Percy was the king, back when Juvie was the great<br>Bitch this doobie is the bait, Patton taught me how to pimp<br>Like one day you here, then gone, that's why Chad was downing shrimp"</p><p><h2>"Smile"</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Isaiah Rashad dropped exactly two songs in the 27-month stretch following the release of<strong> Cilvia Demo</strong>: "<a href=# class=text-word rel>Nelly</a>" and "Smile." "Smile," released in January 2016, is a good example of Rashad's creative flows, and the way he unexpectedly switches up his cadence at every corner. Rashad has a very keen sense of rhythm.</p><h2>"Wat's Wrong" feat. Kendrick Lamar & <a href=# class=text-word>Zacari</a></h2><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Rashad's new debut album <a href=# rel><strong>The Sun's Tirade</strong> is terrific</a>, in particular "Wat's Wrong", a spirited discussion between Rashad and Kendrick Lamar about drug use and its impact on relationships and mental health.</p><p><h2>"4r da Squaw"</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>Though the boy in the music video is not actually Rashad's son, "4r da Squaw" is Rashad's reminder to himself that he is now working for the benefit of his two young children. "By the beer, by ear, by boo.. what Yari saying?" is a reference to his 1-year-old son Yari. "My son used to be into bubbles a lot, and now he's into a dude named Mr. Dougie, and Super Why," <a href=# rel>he told HNHH</a>.</p><p><h2>"Free Lunch"</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>"Free Lunch" broke a 7-month song drought and doubled as announcement that Rashad's album was about to drop. "When i wrote this, I was thinking about honey grain alcohol and just busting nuts," Rashad told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Genius</a>.</p><p><h2>"Tity & Dolla" feat. Hugh Augustine & Jay Rock)</h2></p><p>10 Essential Isaiah Rashad Tracks</p><p>As seen on multiple songs on this list, Rashad is really into southern rap, but as he demonstrates on "Tity & Dolla" -- "Lately I've only been bumping that Yachty / All this Burberry on top of my body!" -- he has no trouble reconciling listening to both Lil Yachty and Playaz Circle.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdlZ4BxfIxqZ2ado6iyr8DImqNmoaOWtqK0jKuYrKCRmXq1vsCcoqxlnprEtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
