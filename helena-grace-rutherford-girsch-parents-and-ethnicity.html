Speaking of her parents, Kelly, her mother, is a well-known actress worldwide. Her roles on Melrose Place, Pretty Little Liars, and Gossip Girl have made her most well-known.</p><p>However, Daniel Giersch, Helena’s father, is a successful businessman from Germany. The 46-year-old is well-known for his legal spat with Google, the dominant search engine. Thus, he launched a same-day postal service in 2000 after acquiring the German rights to the term “G-Mail.”</p><p>He later sued Google after the company released G-Mail, its version of the online email service. Daniel reportedly settled for an unknown sum in 2012. He made his millions in this way.</p><h2><span id=The_Ancestry_and_Ethnicity_of_Helena_Grace_Rutherford>The Ancestry and Ethnicity of Helena Grace Rutherford</span></h2><p>She is descended from her mother and is of Scottish and Northern English descent. Helena also has German heritage on her dad’s side. She is a mixed-race woman.</p><p>Her parents are the second to have her. Hermés Gustaf Daniel Giersch, her elder brother, was welcomed by her parents in October 2006. He will be 13 years old and in middle school in 2020.</p><p>In addition, Helena’s mother Kelly’s marriage to her ex-husband Carlos Tarajano produced no step-siblings. From 2001 to 2002, the actress and the Venezuelan financier were wed.</p><p>Currently, he and his sister reside with his father, who has primary custody of them, in France and Monaco.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Helena_Grace_Rutherford8217s_Parents8217_Marriage_Start>How Did Helena Grace Rutherford’s Parents’ Marriage Start?</span></h2><p>Helena first laid eyes on the boyishly gorgeous Daniel back in 2005. Rutherford was reportedly initially informed about a man who wanted to contact her by a waiter at Il Fornaio.</p><p>To put it mildly, Kelly e-mailed this guy because she found him intriguing. They hit it off right away and began going out. After meeting, Kelly became pregnant with Daniel’s child in less than two months.</p><p>Everything in life was fantastic! On August 18, 2006, two months before to her due date, Sarah and Daniel exchanged vows.</p><h2><span id=Custody_battle_and_divorce_between_Helena8217s_parents>Custody battle and divorce between Helena’s parents</span></h2><p>On December 30, 2008, Kelly filed for divorce from Daniel when she was expecting Helena Grace. Unfortunately, Kelly wasn’t satisfied with the terms of the divorce settlement.</p><p>She had to make many journeys to the court, and the psychological anguish was beginning to take hold. Additionally, for her whole second-trimester pregnancy, she was substantially pregnant. The most notable aspect of their divorce proceedings was Kelly’s insistence on having exclusive custody of her children rather than any financial support.</p><p>Kelly and Daniel came to a temporary custody arrangement in August 2009, agreeing to split 50/50 custody of their two children. Kelly, however, requested the court for primary custody since she was determined to have shared custody of her children.</p><p>The court then decided in 2012 that the custody arrangement would not change. However, because of his involvement in fraud, Daniel was prohibited from entering the US, therefore the children will remain in France and Monaco with their father. Kelly will also be permitted to go to those nations to see them.</p><p>Kelly strongly objected to the proposal and made another appeal. Still, her appeal was turned down. Kelly is permitted visiting privileges, although Daniel currently has exclusive custody of both Helena and Daniel.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Helena_Grace_Rutherford8217s_Parents>What Is The Net Worth of Helena Grace Rutherford’s Parents?</span></h2><p>Daniel, the father of Helena, is a multimillionaire businessman. His case against Google resulted in a sizable financial award. Additionally, he listed his Cannes home for a staggering $14.20 million.</p><p>continues to demonstrate that he has a net worth of more than $100 million.</p><p>Kelly, Helena’s mother, has a $1 million net worth. In June 2013, she filed for bankruptcy. She claimed that the divorce processes were the only reason she had accrued debt of almost $2 million.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Daughter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Hannah Is The Only Family Member That Stays In Contact With Julia Haart After She Is Abandoned</a></h3>Fashion designer and novelist Haart gained notoriety after taking over as CEO of Elite Model Management.
