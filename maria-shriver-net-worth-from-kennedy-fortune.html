The bodybuilder-turned-actor <a href=#>confessed to multiple infidelities</a>. But this was the only one that resulted in a love child – his youngest son, Joseph Baena, who still <a href=#>refuses to use the Schwarzenegger name</a>. Shriver immediately filed for divorce, which was finalized 10 years later, in 2021.</p><p>The former NBC broadcaster received a hefty settlement from the movie star. But even without it, she already had quite a fortune from her inheritance alone. Shriver is a niece of the late U.S. president, John F. Kennedy. Her parents are Special Olympics founder, Eugene Kennedy Shriver, and former U.S. ambassador to France, Sargent Shriver. Here's a breakdown of Shriver's $200 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-01t131522-339.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Vanessa Williams Was "Miserable" While Fighting Off Arnold Schwarzenegger Dating Rumors In The Film, Eraser</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Vanessa Williams had a difficult experience alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 1996 film, Eraser.</span><h2 id=maria-shriver-inherited-millions-in-assets-and-trusts-from-the-kennedy-family>Maria Shriver Inherited Millions In Assets And Trusts From The Kennedy Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar42640494.jpg><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Shriver collects income from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-million dollar assets and trusts under the Kennedy name</a>. Documents show that these assets include "Vornado Realty Trust" and "Vornado Realty Inc.," which are valued at $7.5 million each.</p><p>It is also reported that the Kennedys have amassed over $170 million since 1998, in dividends alone. "The family's financial assets are set up in an ingenious manner – using a system that accepts partnership units instead of cash in order to defer capital gains taxes and depreciation," wrote CNW</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Shriver is grateful for her privileged upbringing, she told <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">struggled to find her identity growing up</a>. "I felt lost a lot growing up because I was always a 'Kennedy,' without a first name or my own identity, really," the philanthropist told the host in 2018. "People would ask me, 'Which Kennedy are you?'"</p><p>"I always felt that they were more interested in the things that came before me than in getting to know me. I was determined to become Maria."</p><p>But through it all, Shriver's mother – who passed in 2009 – inspired her to "perform at a high level." When Winfrey asked how it was like to be Eugene Kennedy Shriver's daughter, the journalist responded: "It was awesome, because she was. And it was challenging, because she was a force of nature."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that her mom "thought everyone could change the world and had no interest in you unless that's what you were doing. She dressed like a man and always had pencils stuck in her hair. She smoked cigars, carried a briefcase, and went to the office every day. She loved power and respected people who worked nonstop. It forced me to perform at a high level."</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger told Maria Shriver's mother, "Your daughter has a really nice ass," the first time he met her in 1977.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-26t120444-667.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel's Audience Erupted After Arnold Schwarzenegger Admitted He Tricked Sylvester Stallone Into A Film That Got Rated 14%</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Arnold Schwarzenegger came clean about a Sylvester Stallone moment alongside Jimmy Kimmel, and the audience loved every bit of it.</span><h2 id=maria-shriver-got-50-of-arnold-schwarzenegger-39-s-fortune-from-their-divorce>Maria Shriver Got 50% Of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Fortune From Their Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar51044893.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Six months after finalizing their divorce in December 2021, Shriver gained rights to 50% of Schwarzenegger's earnings from the time they got married in 1986 to when she filed for divorce in 2011. That means <a href=#>she still gets residuals from Terminator 2</a> and is entitled to her ex-husband's pension. The Junior star is worth $450 million.</p><p>While some sources say <a href=#>Shriver also had a lover before her split from Schwarzenegger</a>, the latter only had nice things to say about his ex-wife. In 2012, amid their divorce, he told Mario Lopez: "Luckily, Maria has been a terrific mother. We work together even though we're going through a divorce."</p><p>"We make sure that the kids grow up to be really good human beings."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Shriver has "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no plans on publicly responding</a>" to Schwarzenegger's 2023 <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> documentary, Arnold – where he opened up about his "failed" marriage. "[Maria] would like to keep what happened in the past behind her and not relive some of the challenges she faced in her marriage," an anonymous tipster told Us Weekly.</p><p>They added that the former NBC anchor is "in a really good place with Arnold now, and they're able to focus on what matters most to them — their children. She doesn't live with regrets and chooses to focus her life on positive energy and moving forward."

She anchored the weekend editions of the Today show and the NBC Nightly News, and became a political correspondent for Dateline NBC. She left in 2004 to assume the role of First Lady of California alongside Schwarzenegger. However, the network only viewed her exit as an "extended leave of absence" in hopes she'd return.</p><p>"Given her career at NBC and the election of her husband as governor of California, Maria found herself in an unusual situation," said her then-chief-of-staff Daniel Zingale. "But there is absolutely nothing unusual about her exit agreement with NBC." Shriver was reportedly paid between $100,000 to $1 million during each of her last three years at NBC.</p><p>Shriver's journalistic career earned her a Peabody Award in 1998. Ten years before that, she co-anchored NBC's Emmy-winning coverage of that year's Summer Olympics. In 2013, she returned to NBC as a special anchor, after refusing to make a journalistic comeback. In May 2007, she revealed:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I kind of made up my mind I did not want to go back into the news division after watching the Anna Nicole Smith frenzy."</p><p>The mother of four explained she "was just flabbergasted by that. How it was across the board, all-encompassing, and I just thought to myself, 'This is not where I want to work.'" In September 2004, Shriver was optimistic about balancing her political and broadcasting career, saying:</p><p>"One of the goals, when the news division suggested that I go on leave, was, 'I'm going to find my way back on the air. That was important to me, because I felt that I still had a lot to give as a journalist."</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's children with Maria Shriver are <a href=#>not close to their father's love child</a> , Joseph Baena.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqZlnq0tNGirZ6qXaOytXnWqKmtoF2bv7C5jKScp6aVmcZuss6rq66mlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
