Over the past few years, the Oscar-winning actress, 41 — who filed for divorce from husband Brad Pitt September 19 — has grown close to Lady Arminka Helic. The Bosnian-born member of the U.K. House of Lords once worked as an adviser to former British foreign secretary William Hague. Jolie has also become tight with another former Hague aide, Chloe Dalton. Both women, according to an insider, are currently with Jolie and her children, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, at a rented home in Los Angeles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hague has praised their work, telling U.K. newspaper the <i>Evening Standard</i> in 2015 that the trio “are full of ideas.”</p><p>The source says Helic was also instrumental in getting Jolie involved with the London School of Economics’ Centre for Women, Peace and Security. In 2017, Jolie will lecture as a guest professor.</p><p>Helic in particular has become more influential in all aspects of Jolie’s life. “Angie trusts Arminka implicitly and values her opinion more than anyone else right now,” continues the source. “She has been taking on recommendations over the months when it comes to other things such as who works on her security team and the children’s education.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last April, Helic was even spotted out with Jolie and her kids on a shopping excursion in London.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZWperW0xGauqKWVo3q4tM5mn5qulWKvprHNZpqlp6Oaubp5wJ2toquZo7Rurc2gnKWhnpZ6q7vLopxmr2RpfniAkmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
