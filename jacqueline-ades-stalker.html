This was a journey."</h2><p class=dropcaps>In a jailhouse press conference, a woman who was arrested after sending 65,000 texts to a man she met on an online dating site attempted to <a href=# rel=noopener>justify her actions</a>, and explain that they were nothing more than the actions of a woman in love.</p><p>“I felt like I met my soulmate and I thought we would just do what everybody else did and we would get married and everything would be fine,” 31-year-old Jacqueline Ades said in the conference, which took place at the Phoenix, Ariz. jailhouse where she’s been detained.</p><p>Last January, Ades <a href=# rel=noopener>began stalking her victim</a>, a Paradise Valley man who she referred to as “Issac” who she met through an online dating site called Luxy meant for millionaire matchmaking. The two went on just one date — Ades said it was Shabbat at Issac’s parents’ house — before Ades began sending him thousands of text messages, each of them more ludicrous than the last.</p><p>Police claim that some of the messages surpassed ludicrousy, and were full on threatening.</p><p>“Don’t ever try to leave me… I’ll kill you… I don’t wanna be a murderer!” one read. “I hope you die… you rotten filthy Jew,” read another.</p><p>Some referenced explicit details involving violence.</p><p>“I’d wear your fascia ‘n the top of your skull ‘n your hands ‘n feet,” said one. “Oh, what I would do w/your blood… I’d wanna bathe in it,” said another.</p><p>She claimed she sent him the texts because it helped her find information on him.</p><p>Jacqueline Ades began her 20-minute press conference looking bewildered. She commented excitedly about being on Fox News before delving into her story. Breathlessly, she spun a wild tale of taking a road trip from Florida to Utah, then to Arizona, obsessed with the number 33. Scattered, she explained how her left eye’s axis was the same as Jesus’ age, and that a bartender said he’d help her find her “healing angel.”</p><p>Though her eyes glazed over every time she’s discussing her journey, when confronted with her crimes, she shut down, repeatedly telling the journalists that she “doesn’t want to talk about those things.” When asked why she didn’t want to talk about them, she paused thoughtfully, then responded: “You have negative energy.”</p><p>Then, as if she’d never been asked a question in the first place, she resumed discussing why the pyramid on the dollar bill was so significant to her. She also explained that the motivation behind her stalking was Einstein’s theory of relativity, claiming that E=mc2 is “the equation of eternal love.”</p><p>“It means one boy thing, plus one girl thing. The boy is the light, the light makes the love work really hard,” she said. She believes she is the love, and that all of her efforts were just hard work.</p><p>At one point, she turned the tables on Issac, calling him a stalker, and telling reporters that he put a tracking device on her car and that she didn’t want to stay at his villa in Mexico because she was afraid he would film her.</p><p>Ades didn’t seem to have any grasp of the situation at all, denying carrying weapons that police reports detail she did, and insisting that texts sent to her by someone named “Carol” were actually from Issac. At one point, a reporter asks her to confirm the number of texts that she sent.</p><p>“65,000 text messages, that’s like next level stuff,” he said.</p><p>“That’s it?” she replied. “That’s it?” he repeated.</p><p>“Huh,” she said. “To me, it seemed like more.”</p><p>When asked about her current situation, she seemed eerily calm with being in jail, and even open to the possibility of remaining there forever.</p><p>“If Issac wants me to go to jail, I should be in jail,” she said calmly. “I appreciate it.”</p><p>Jacqueline Ades is currently being held without bond and is scheduled to appear in court on May 15.</p><p>Next, check out the story of <a href=#>Richard Ramirez, an even creepier</a>, more famous stalker.
