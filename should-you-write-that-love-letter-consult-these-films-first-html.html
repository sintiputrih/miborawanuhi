Movies are a visual medium, of course, but sometimes nothing gets the point across quite like the written word. Oftentimes, a letter is simply there to unload some exposition or add color to a relationship — but there are many movies where the letter (or letters) are integral to the plot. In Netflix’s latest rom-com To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, letters are the movie. The film’s heroine, Lara Jean, writes love letters to five boys, but they’re meant for her eyes only. Obviously, though, those letters get mailed out … and that’s where the story kicks off.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmgj001k3g60fua7dcac@published data-word-count=94>Although the secret letter mailing works out for Lara Jean, sometimes letters in movies are more trouble than they’re worth. Regardless of the outcome, there’s always a lesson to be learned from characters trying their hand at expressing themselves and their heart’s desires through writing. We’ve taken a closer look at nine movies with letters baked into the plot to learn a thing or two about putting our hearts to pen (or quill or typewriter ink, really whatever you’ve got) and paper. Read on before you decide to mail out your own secret stash.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmqi002g3g60apmwbmp5@published data-word-count=10><strong>The Movie: To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before (2018)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqd4l500323g60jfa2pvac@published data-word-count=16><strong>The Lovers:</strong> Lara Jean Song Covey (Lana Condor) and the five boys she’s had crushes on.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqd66h00383g60y6wfv8kg@published data-word-count=105><strong>The Letters:</strong> Shy high-schooler Lara Jean is afraid of love, so whenever she has overwhelming feelings for a boy, she writes a letter to him to get it out of her system. She then puts that letter in an envelope and addresses it. It’s a surprise to literally no one except Lara Jean when those five letters, supposedly safely hidden away, get mailed out (spoiler: her little sister did it), and the boys have follow-up questions. Humiliation aside, the letters put Lara Jean back into the orbit of old crush and cool guy Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), and the two strike up an unlikely romance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqd7xr003e3g60aa5xvlch@published data-word-count=34><strong>Are These Letters Any Good?: </strong>They’re age-appropriate letters written by a hopeless romantic.

They’re harmless, they help an introvert express herself, and despite some awkwardness with her older sister who discovers her ex got a letter from Lara Jean, they ultimately lead our heroine to find love.

While he’s off writing and trying not to be so broke, the two build their relationship over a series of gorgeous, swoony love letters. Would you expect anything less from John Keats? They’re all “I cannot exist without you” and “three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.” These letters and his poetry are really all Fanny has left of John when he dies of tuberculosis soon after.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqdjq100483g60ot8qhbdz@published data-word-count=16><strong>Are These Letters Any Good?: </strong>No other letters need apply, these letters are the best letters.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqdlml004e3g60y5gxkg2e@published data-word-count=43><strong>Should These Letters Have Been Written?: </strong>Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.

Picture Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as business rivals falling for each other over email). Their letters to each other run the gamut of topics, and it’s easy to see how they go gaga for each other. And when <a href=#>Jimmy Stewart reads some of those letters out loud</a>, well, gird your loins, people.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqe28t00523g60ntusl0a4@published data-word-count=19><strong>Are These Letters Any Good?: </strong>They’re no John Keats, but they are very, very nice all on their own.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqe60w00583g60wef7e2lh@published data-word-count=18><strong>Should These Letters Have Been Written?: </strong>How else would Klara and Alfred know they’re crazy for each other?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqe7ll005e3g606bqxkqgl@published data-word-count=36><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?: </strong>Be nice to your co-workers in case one of them turns out to be a secret love interest.

It is an extremely large step toward Elizabeth and Darcy taking the blinders off their dumb, beautiful eyes and finally seeing each other for who they are: soul mates!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmhv001m3g607kla5ykg@published data-word-count=53><strong>Is This Letter Any Good?: </strong>It’s mostly business, but written in the style of the day, it still sounds flowery and romantic. On his sister and her ill-fated affair with Wickham, Darcy writes: “I will not attempt to convey the depths of Georgiana’s despair.” I mean, the brooding dude can turn a phrase.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmhs001l3g60q2uesra8@published data-word-count=72><strong>Should This Letter Have Been Written?:</strong> Definitely! Of all the letters discussed today, this one has the most concrete purpose — most are meant to woo with words or break hearts, but this one is about righting wrongs and making sense of some confusing actions. Darcy isn’t great at conveying emotion face-to-face, so if he needed to write a letter then he needed to write a letter. It gets a lot done.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmj4001q3g60t93mb36n@published data-word-count=50><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?:</strong> Misunderstandings kill love pretty easily, so sometimes it is best to really clarify things without interruption via the written word. Also, apologize to people. Oh, and also: Read letters from mysterious men with moody music playing the background. It adds a special something to the occasion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmjj001r3g6001a43z9d@published data-word-count=5><strong>The Movie: The Notebook (2004)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqegp1005w3g603jpt9g4l@published data-word-count=13><strong>The Lovers: </strong>Noah (Ryan Gosling, James Garner) and Allie (Rachel McAdams, Gena Rowlands)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqein800623g60r9488j3b@published data-word-count=157><strong>The Letter: </strong>There’s a whole year worth of letters in this movie, but because moms are evil and hate love, Allie never receives the letters Noah wrote to her. Instead, they were torn apart, and her family moved away. When she reunites with Noah years later and is all, “WTF didn’t you write?” he’s like, “Excuse me, I wrote my sad little heart out to you 365 TIMES.” (I’m paraphrasing, but Allie’s mom withholding those letters really messed things up.) Thankfully, she saved the letters and gives them to Allie (feeling guilty, mom?), so we do get to hear <a href=#>Noah’s final letter to Allie</a>, in which he tells her he knows it’s over (spoiler: it still isn’t over!). He tells her that he’ll “remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees,” and honestly, people should take note that talking about spending time under trees is insanely romantic for reasons no one knows. Love is a mystery!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmjp001v3g60fypvassh@published data-word-count=29><strong>Is This Letter Any Good?: </strong>I’ll take the dream house over the letter any day, but “the best love is the kind that awakens the soul” isn’t so bad.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmjl001s3g60hye2oo2o@published data-word-count=43><strong>Should This Letter Have Been Written?: </strong>Technically, no. Noah shouldn’t have needed to write this letter but, moms. At least the 365 letters offer proof that he didn’t just abandon Allie and their existence helps reconcile things between them. I GUESS THERE’S THAT.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmjm001t3g600fzimjkp@published data-word-count=47><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?: </strong>I know he joined the army and was thus a bit busy, but, like, if your true love isn’t replying you should probably Go To Her at least once.

Yeesh.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmjo001u3g602pgb63sj@published data-word-count=5><strong>The Movie: Dear John (2010)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmkp001w3g60xnojelbe@published data-word-count=9><strong>The Lovers: </strong>John (Channing Tatum) and Savannah (Amanda Seyfried)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcml1001y3g608cr9sr5v@published data-word-count=102><strong>The Letters: </strong>Yeah, yeah, Nicholas Sparks loves using letters as plot devices and really doubles down here with the whole “Dear John” letter thing. John and Savannah fall in love on the beaches of South Carolina while John is on leave from the Army. When he has to go back, the two stay in touch over letters until it gets to be too much for Savannah and she writes him AN ACTUAL DEAR JOHN LETTER because we are blessed. Channing Tatum is very sad, but eventually the guy she dumped him for dies and they reunite … so, that’s weird and interesting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmky001x3g60sbiujx19@published data-word-count=72><strong>Are These Letters Any Good?: </strong>Snoozefest. The best letter in this movie is actually not a romantic love letter at all, but the letter John writes to his dying father (played by Richard Jenkins) with whom he has a contentious relationship because of his father’s undiagnosed Asperger’s. Now, that’s a letter. This movie should’ve just been about John and his dad but I guess people want the love, so here we are.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcml6001z3g60fudmva1l@published data-word-count=33><strong>Should These Letters Have Been Written?:</strong> They were in love and he was in the army, so it makes sense. Also, the movie is called Dear John so there better be letters somewhere.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcml900213g60wfnnfu7b@published data-word-count=39><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?: </strong>I guess just beware if your name is John and someone likes writing letters to you because one day they may see the ‘Dear John’ humor of it all and things will take a turn.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcml800203g60msmo856c@published data-word-count=4><strong>The Movie: Casablanca (1942)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmq00233g60t7cxas9z@published data-word-count=11><strong>The Lovers: </strong>Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmr00243g60bt70cvle@published data-word-count=110><strong>The Letter: </strong>When we first meet ex-pat and nightclub owner Rick, he’s a bitter man with loyalty to no one. We quickly learn it’s because of this letter. Well, okay, it’s because of Ilsa, the person who wrote this letter. Rick and Ilsa had a whirlwind romance in Paris, but just as they are about to flee the city as it falls to the Germans, Rick is stood up by Ilsa at the train station. Friend and piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) delivers a letter informing him that she cannot go with him and he can’t know why. And all of this happens in the rain, making it infinitely sadder.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmv00273g60g9bwgm8d@published data-word-count=38><strong>Is This Letter Any Good?: </strong>It’s brusque and vague and offers no closure — Ilsa might as well have just written the lyrics to “As Time Goes By” if she wanted to break the guy’s heart so badly.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmu00263g60cafj2cgg@published data-word-count=72><strong>Should This Letter Have Been Written?: </strong>No! All Rick wanted to do was drink Champagne with her, love her forever, and say, “Here’s looking at you, kid.” At the very least Ilsa should’ve dumped Rick in person. Her husband was alive — that’s a very understandable reason to break up with someone. He would’ve understood! I mean, he still would’ve felt like he had “his guts kicked out,” but he would’ve understood.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmo00223g60ii1t84da@published data-word-count=17><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?: </strong>Always read sad letters in the rain in order to mask your tears.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmmu00253g60erae2ugc@published data-word-count=4><strong>The Movie: Atonement (2007)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmot002d3g6091fcnom9@published data-word-count=11><strong>The Lovers:</strong> Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmod00283g60aaamq60z@published data-word-count=185><strong>The Letter:</strong> Ugh, this fucking letter. Robbie, the Tallis’s housekeeper’s son, writes a series of letters apologizing to Cecilia after the two get in a vase-based argument that is really about Robbie’s plans to go off to medical school and the boiling sexual tension that exists between them. He writes one very formal, very 1935 British version and one very sexually explicit version that might cause a person to clutch his or her pearls even in 2018. Mistakenly, it is this latter letter that he puts in an envelope and hands to 13-year-old Briony (Saoirse Ronan) to deliver to her older sister. Briony reads the letter, is scandalized because she’s a 13-year-old who doesn’t understand what’s going on, and hurt because she loves Robbie. Jealous of her sister, angry with Robbie, bored, and naïve, when Briony discovers her cousin has been sexually assaulted on the grounds, she accuses Robbie and offers the letter as proof of his deviancy. Robbie is wrongly imprisoned, the lovers are thwarted, and then World War II happens and if you can even believe it: things get devastatingly worse from there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmor002b3g60k5k1aip0@published data-word-count=12><strong>Is This Letter Any Good?:</strong> I mean, it gets to the point.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmoh00293g60goyo3yhl@published data-word-count=10><strong>Should This Letter Have Been Written?: </strong>The hardest of nos.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmor002c3g60ivfow011@published data-word-count=7><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?:</strong> Don’t write letters.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmoj002a3g60vez5h6by@published data-word-count=6><strong>The Movie: The Lake House (2006)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmqm002j3g60qmm6m7bp@published data-word-count=11><strong>The Lovers: </strong>Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) and Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjksqcmql002i3g60nabakn1w@published data-word-count=151><strong>The Letters: </strong>Lonely Chicagoans Kate and Alex realize that they own the same gorgeous glass lake house two years apart — and can communicate through time via their magic time-traveling mailbox. 2004 Alex and 2006 Kate begin writing honest, flirty, romantic letters to one another, and also one time Alex (he’s an architect, naturally) takes Kate on a walking tour of Chicago by letter.
