From a shop assistant to a "defender of the Earth", the heroine definitely changed the most out of anyone by travelling with the Doctor and in many ways, Billie Piper's real-life career was similar to her character as she went from Doctor Who to the critically acclaimed to winning an Olivier Award for Best Actress for her performance in</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b740e41c460-billie-piper-z.jpg><h3><strong>John Barrowman - Captain Jack Harkness&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=ezyyDVUE6Gjd data-wc=62>Now for a companion who will never really change (until he turns into the Face of Boe of course). Captain Jack was the wise-cracking, flirtatious companion, and John Barrowman continued the character's story in the Doctor Who spinoff which concluded in 2011. Since then, John has found great success appearing as Malcolm Merlyn in and</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/40afe68918a8-john-barrowman-z.jpg><h3><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;Doctor Who's Pearl Mackie on playing first openly gay companion</a></h3><h3><strong>Catherine Tate - Donna Noble&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=e5XIYLjAEUJF data-wc=81>Donna was an hilarious companion to David Tennant's Doctor, but ended up having one of the most tragic send offs after her character was forced to forget everything about her adventures – leading her to revert back to her old self from before she met the Doctor. Since her devastating departure from the show in 2010, Catherine has gone from strength to strength – from reuniting with David for the stage show to starring in</p><span></span><h3><strong>Freema Agyeman - Martha Jones&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=efqCvZoxMSzo data-wc=54>Martha Jones was a great assistant, but ended up leaving the Doctor when she developed romantic feelings for him that weren't reciprocated. Since shutting the TARDIS door for good, Freeman has gone on to do a host of TV shows, and landed a role in as Nomi's straight talking yet caring girlfriend, Amanita.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d4cbcd6127e-freema-agyeman-z.jpg><h3><strong>Karen Gillan - Amy Pond&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=ek3Xo53GhB6n data-wc=52>Joining the show in 2010, Karen's Amy Pond was a funny and vibrant addition to the show right up until her departure in 2012 thanks to the Weeping Angels.

Since leaving, Arthur joined alumni John Barrowman on and played Rev. Paul Coates in Addressing his stint on the show, Arthur also performed a hilarious spoof of hinting that he wanted to move on from the sci-fi show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/816cedc467cf-arthur-darvill-z.jpg><h3><strong>Alex Kingston – River Song&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eXugMt3td3im data-wc=63>Although you're never quite sure when the enigmatic River Song might leave Doctor Who, it seemed like Alex Kingston's final, poignant appearance with Peter Capaldi's Doctor marked the end of an era back in 2015. Since then, Alex has been as nonstop as her character, making appearances in and among others.</p><p id=e8w4P_8IXAWn data-wc=14><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;Peter Capaldi reveals real reason he quit Doctor Who and hints at replacement</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b086e5d8731-alex-kingston-z.jpg><h3><strong>Jenna Coleman – Clara Oswold&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eDyHnXlz7Un_ data-wc=60>Since Jenna's 'the impossible girl' exited the show in 2015 after appearing as the mysterious character Clara (along with her other roles) for the best part of three seasons.
