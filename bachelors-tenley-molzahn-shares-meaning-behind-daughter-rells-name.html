Characteristics we have been praying over our little love since we learned we were pregnant! So her name was inspired by Rell Sunn!”</p><p>As for the infant’s middle moniker, she is named after both of her grandfathers. “We’ve had her middle name planned long before we found out we were having a baby!” the former ABC personality concluded her caption.</p><p>She and her husband became parents last month. “We’ve been completely captivated & swept off our feet in love with our precious baby girl,” the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise </a>alum captioned<a href=#> her daughter’s Instagram debut</a>. “We are soooo in love, she’s absolute perfection.”</p><p>The baby news came six months after Molzahn revealed she was <a href=#>pregnant with her first child</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bachelor-Tenley-Molzahn-Explains-Special-Meaning-Behind-Newborn-Daughter-Rell-Name.jpg><p>Since becoming a mom in September, the former dancer has already dealt with <a href=#>“brutal” mom-shamers.</a> “I knew it was a thing, and I was prepared to be presented with it — but it’s NASTY,” she captioned a Saturday, October 3, Instagram post. “I can actually hear the judgements right now with this photo because you can’t see my baby’s nose and mouth. … I don’t ever want to have to defend myself on people’s assumptions — they are assumptions. And I don’t want the negativity or the shaming to steal our joy. And really, shame on those who shame others.”</p><p>Molzahn competed on season 14 of The Bachelor in 2010, followed by Bachelor Pad and Bachelor in Paradise.
