The Boondock Saints star’s girlfriend, actress <strong><a href=#>Diane Kruger,</a></strong> called Burton a “stunning bride” in the comments section of her Instagram.</p><p>While reports surfaced in 2014 that Burton and Morgan had tied the knot, the<a href=#> twosome confirmed on Monday that they did not exchange vows</a> until Saturday, October 5.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hilarie-Burton-and-Jeffrey-Dean-Morgan-wedding-photo.jpg><p>“Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real. We’ve lived as husband and wife for a decade. We’ve built a family, and a farm and found our community,” the Lethal Weapon actress gushed via Instagram. “From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan, he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad. Standing up there with our children at our sides – celebrating all that has been – was bliss. I love you Jeffrey. I love our intimate group of friends and family who joined us. I love the various circles of loved ones who have supported us over the years.”</p><p>Burton’s former White Collar costar <strong>Willie Garson</strong> also attended the nuptials. While reports previously stated that the actress and former One Tree Hill second assistant director<strong> Ian Prange</strong> were married from 2004 to 2009, Burton clarified on Monday that her marriage to Morgan was her first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6osq95wJyipZ2jYruwvsyapWaqlZqxtr%2BMqJ2foZOerrWxw2afoqSRp7amecmenZ%2Bqla7AbsPEnZuippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
