Williams Believed His Scar Helped Him in Career</h2><p>The talented actor believed&nbsp;that his scar from the middle of his forehead to the right side of his mouth helped him get roles in movies. He opened up about the scar during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with NPR</a> in 2014.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As per his accounts, Williams was having a hard time getting significant roles. He was working as a dancer for&nbsp;Madonna and George Michael. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But that all changed once he got embroiled in a nasty altercation on his&nbsp;25th birthday. That night, he was having a good time at a party in Queens. He went outside to get some air and saw that his friends were surrounded by strange men.&nbsp;</p><p>To minimize the tension, Williams loudly informed his friends he was heading home. But his notice caught the attention of one man, who instantly started following him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When the then-young artist tried to stop the man, the stranger put a razor blade in his hands, between his middle and ring finger, and immediately slashed&nbsp;Williams' face. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The actor recounted he and his friends barely escaped with their lives that night. But then, he shared how&nbsp;the cut changed his life forever.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Producers didn't want him to dance in songs anymore but play thug roles and hardened men. Just like that, he got his breakout role alongside Tupac Shakur in the 1996 film Bullet. And the rest is history.</p><p>In a separate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2011,&nbsp;Williams explained why he didn't fight back in that ordeal. He clarified he didn't want blood on his hands.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>The Wire star</a>&nbsp;added he would find himself ugly if he had taken the other route. But he stayed with the positivity and chose not to react in revenge.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Michael K. Williams Died at 54</h2><p>Williams, age 54, was found dead at his&nbsp;Brooklyn penthouse apartment on September 6, 2021. His nephew discovered his body in the living room, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to People</a>.</p><p>Just after the tragedy, his representative confirmed the news of his death to the news outlet.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Although his cause of death hasn't been confirmed, it was&nbsp;reported that drug&nbsp;paraphernalia was found in his apartment. There is a suspicion that the actor&nbsp;died of an overdose. He had a history of&nbsp;drug dependency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWZmLWisctmomavmaG5qq3MrGSsm5GneqWxwJ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
