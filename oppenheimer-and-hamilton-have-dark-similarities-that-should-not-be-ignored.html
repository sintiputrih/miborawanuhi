Of course, the argument is that this is entertainment and not necessarily a historically accurate portrayal. Still, people should know.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>That brings us to Oppenheimer. In a lengthy Twitter thread, journalist and author Alisa Lynn Valdés highlighted a pretty big omission to the movie: how Hispanic families in New Mexico were treated after Oppenheimer’s secret lab was built.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This quote, from the <a href=#>@nytimes</a> review of the OPPENHEIMER film: "He served as director of a clandestine weapons lab built in a near-desolate stretch of Los Alamos, in New Mexico"…</p><p>It was inhabited by Hispanos. They were given less than 24 hr to leave. Their farms bulldozed. 1</p>— Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, M.S. (@AlisaValdesRod1) <a href=#>July 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>The whole thread is understandably heavy and definitely worth reading, but I’ll summarize it for you. Basically, Hispanic families had been “living on the same land for centuries” and when Oppenheimer and company made them leave, they also killed all their livestock and immediately bulldozed all their farms.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>These were American citizens, by the way. After they were displaced, the men were hired to work with beryllium, a toxic element that causes lung damage when inhaled and a deadly condition called Berylliosis. The white men were given protective gear, but the Hispanic men were not.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>All of the Hispanic men died, she said, and lost everything they had. This is weirdly not in the movie.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Valdés also told the story of “Loyda Martinez, a remarkable whistleblower whose family’s land was seized for the labs.” Her father was one of the men who died from the poisoning as well.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Martinez was a brilliant woman who won a class action lawsuit against the government for the deceased men, and won. She then filed a second second lawsuit for fair pay for women scientists.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Valdés said she’s been trying to sell a movie based on Martinez “for 20 years …, But, no. We want more films about the ‘complex and troubled’ ‘heroic’ white men, who conducted their GENIUS in a ‘virtually unpopulated’ place. These are ALL lies. This is mythology in service to white supremacy and the military industrial complex, masquerading as ‘nuanced.'”</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Because of the actions of the government, she said, “people in northern NM … now have the highest rates of heroin overdose deaths in the nation. The generational trauma and forced poverty is outrageous. We need the real stories of Oppenheimer to be told.”</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Here’s a picture of Martinez’s mother and father, who later died of berylliosis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Loyda's mother and father. Her dad was driven off their family's land when Oppenheimer and the US government seized it to make the labs. They then hired him, made him work with berrylium without protective gear (his white bosses got PPE) and he died of berryliosis, like many did. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rpOBva9ztn</a></p>— Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, M.S.
