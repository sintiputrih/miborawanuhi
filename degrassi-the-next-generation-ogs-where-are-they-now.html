Drake’s team and [director]<strong> Karena [Evans]</strong> did a fantastic job of orchestrating the whole thing.”</p><p>McDonald noted to the outlet that the shoot was emotional.</p><p>“We laughed; we cried; we had the best time,” the actress said. “I am so proud of how far each of us came from when we first walked those hallways 17 years ago.”</p><p>Collins, who played Paige Michaelchuk, added that it was the “best night.”</p><p>“It was the reunion we’ve always wanted, and we were thrilled to do it with our old friend,” she told Variety. “Thank you Aubrey, and thank you to the unbelievably dedicated fans of our show.”</p><p>Degrassi made headlines in February 2021 after <strong>Cassie Steele</strong> recreated one of Manny Santos’ iconic looks — the infamous low-rise jeans with the bright blue thong — as part of the “Buss It” challenge on TikTok.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Steele shared the video to Instagram, Drake commented, “Fit is museum worthy tbh Santos.”</p><p>Scroll through for an update on the cast:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZsqi%2BwKyqomWknbJuusSxq2aflaOys63ToqanZZ%2BcwG7Dx56pnmWRp7JuwMeesGamn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
