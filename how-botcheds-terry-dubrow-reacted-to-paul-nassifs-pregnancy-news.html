It’s very, very simple. It’s very sustainable.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahp6dir7DAwqGcnatdqbKzvthmm66aoqTEbr7EmpqtnZRiwbB5z5qspWWelsC0tcWsZKmqlZy7orrCsmSnnaeofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
