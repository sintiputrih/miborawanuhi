The store, James Ascher, is named after her son, who was diagnosed with a brain encephalocele months before his birth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Southern-Charm-Alum-Jennifer-Snowdon-Is-Engaged-to-Lee-02.jpg><p>“Honestly at this point, after everything I’ve gone through, there’s not much that I’m afraid of anymore,” she told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in 2017. “I’m proud of myself and proud of Ascher. After I got the news, I’d pray every night and I’d talk to my baby and tell him to be strong. I’d tell him you can rewrite what’s supposed to be a bad history.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She gave birth weeks early via c-section, but her baby was OK — and that was all that mattered.</p><p>“I couldn’t hold him for two days, I couldn’t even see him properly because I couldn’t stand and his crib in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was too high for me to look into fully,” she revealed at the time. “But he was only in there for five days. I remember going to see him that first time and looking around and thinking that he was the healthiest baby in there. The others were fighting for their lives. He was only on a respirator while coming off anesthetics and on a feeding tube briefly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmionqiuNSmZKOdnqO2p7HRZqqnp6eZsq95yKxknqaXlrSmsIytpmaklZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
