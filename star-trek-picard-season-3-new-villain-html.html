At the New York City Comic Con, the cast and crew came together to reveal the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first trailer</a>&nbsp;for eager fans looking for a sneak peek of what they can expect for the series finale. Among the stellar cast that is reprising their roles and the return of some classic villains from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>, fans also got a glimpse at a mysterious new villain, played by Amanda Plummer.</p><p>The trailer released shows Picard and company matching wits (and starship firepower) with a maniacal and mysterious alien captain. While the trailer doesn’t give the audience very much insight into who the character is, she is portrayed by Amanda Plummer, who is the real-life daughter of legendary actor Christopher Plummer. The casting itself may give fans a clue as to some background on this new unknown villain and what the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise is up against in the final season of&nbsp;Star Trek: Picard Season 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/amanda-plummer-picard-900x506.jpg><p>The late Christopher Plummer portrayed the villainous General Chang in the sixth big screen production,&nbsp;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, where he came into conflict with Picard’s predecessor,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Captain James T. Kirk</a>. Chang endeavored to sabotage the peace talks between the Klingons and the Federation of Planets. He facilitated an attack on the Klingon ship on the way to the peace summit and framed Kirk and McCoy, putting them on trial and securing a conviction, but not a death penalty.</p><p>Chang attempted to orchestrate their murder on the way to their banishment, and eventually, his betrayal was uncovered, falling to the Enterprise. Of course, his daughter playing a villain in&nbsp;Star Trek: Picard Season 3&nbsp;doesn’t mean it is Chang’s descendant, but it could be a fun little throwback.&nbsp;</p><p>That wasn’t the only villain teased for the final season of the series, as the trailer showed the return of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brent Spiner</a>, but not as Data; instead, he is returning as Lore. Lore showed up in Season 7 of&nbsp;Star Trek: The Next Generation, and while they thought he was Data’s long-lost twin, he was actually an evil version created by the same man. While the crew disassembled Lore at the end of Season 7, he is returning to&nbsp;Star Trek: Picard&nbsp;for Season 3.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer also confirms that Daniel Davis will return as Professor Moriarty in Star Trek: Picard Season 3. The Sir Arthur Conan Doyle villain was created by the onboard computer in a spiteful move to beat Data’s deductive skills, but he eventually became self-aware and took the ship hostage. The last time fans saw the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sherlock Holmes</a> villain, he was trapped in the computer, believing he was traveling the galaxy.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the original series is returning to end the journey of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean-Luc Picard</a>&nbsp;character, and the showrunners have said that none of the original cast is safe from being eliminated. With a combination of two returning foes and the addition of a new adversary, it could spell the end for the entire crew in&nbsp;Star Trek: Picard season 3.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irpJa%2FbsDRnqJmqJmYrrOwjKycmqufo3p0ec2ermaumaG5orXNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
