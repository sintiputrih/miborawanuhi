Almost one year ago to the day, comments about him falling off surfaced. Of course, CAMP heard them and had this to say about it. "Don’t no artist wanna hear that they <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fell off.</a> But you got to understand, what’s the definition of falling off. N****s use that term so loosely. Falling off to me is f****d up somewhere under a bridge with no paper, with a box saying: ‘Can I get some food?’ That’s falling off."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On top of that, K CAMP was dealing with a scary <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">vocal chord surgery</a>. Luckily it was not life-threatening. Nonetheless, it was another obstacle that got in the way of him building out his career. These could be reasons why it took almost two years between his newest project, Float 2 London, and Vibe Forever.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-float-2-london-by-k-camp>Listen To Float 2 London By K CAMP</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But, that clearly did not stop K CAMP from pulling through for his fans. Additionally, this project is an independent release. According to The Source, he and his label, Interscope, decided to part ways. K CAMP deserves major kudos for everything he has had to overcome to get to this point. So, be sure to check out his new tape with the links above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new album&nbsp;Float 2 London, by K CAMP?
