In fact, the actor has been open about his past and the fact that he grew up on a boat. "We didn't have any money, but my parents did work a lot," he told CBS. "They had an aquarium-cleaning business, my mom worked for a sound company, Dad taught acting and made videos on chiropractic care. They were all over the place."</p><p>He continued, "They traveled a lot, searching. They were on their own journey and I happened to just go along with them." Howey said that when he wanted something to eat, his dad Bill had to cast a line to catch a fish. He also admitted that there were times he didn't think they'd survive. The star explained, "When there would be a gale [strong wind], my parents would get so freaked about capsizing, they would get harnessed in, bring up the safety raft, and put me in my bunk. So, I would be in my bunk for three days at a time, just coming out to make sure that my parents were still alive."</p><p>He told <a href=#>Forbes</a> the experience humbled him as he "got to fish for lunch and dinner. I really learned how to survive on the ocean." Despite the hard times, Howey is now worth an estimated $2 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1lbX15e8eormalpZi1brXSZqqtnaaaeqm71p6wZqqVlrmtxYywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
