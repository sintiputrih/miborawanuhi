"I been dealing with this s**t for five years with this case.

He and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> were taken into custody after a traffic stop in February of that year. Nudy was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and being associated with a criminal street gang, while 21 Savage was arrested for being an illegal immigrant. This marked the start of 21 Savage's longwinded legal battle that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">finally came to a close</a> earlier this month.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans are just glad that Young Nudy has one less obstacle in the way of his career, which only continues to grow. He recently teamed up with Latto and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> for a remix of "Peaches & Eggplants," was joined onstage by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a> at his show, and more. He also appears on the deluxe edition of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Killer Mike</a>'s new album MICHAEL, which <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">wasn't easy</a>. Apparently, Killer Mike had to phone in Nudy's mom to get him on the LP. What do you think of Young Nudy finally beating his case? How do you feel about his reaction?
