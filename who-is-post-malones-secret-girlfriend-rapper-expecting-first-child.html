On Tuesday, May 2, the singer, whose real name is Austin Post, confirmed that he‚Äôs expecting his first child with his girlfriend, whose identity has been kept secret throughout their relationship. "I'm excited for this next chapter in my life, I'm the happiest I've ever been, and for since I could remember I was sad. Time to take care of my body and my family and friends, and spread as much love as we can every day," Post told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel>Post</a> is one of the most successful musicians in the <a href=#>music industry</a>, having won three American Music Awards, ten Billboard Music Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award. However, his love life has been a source of speculation for years. Is Post Malone married? Who is Post Malone's girlfriend? These are some commonly asked questions by fans over the years.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Post Malone got face tattoos because he was insecure about his appearance: 'I‚Äôm an ugly-a** motherf**ker'</a></p><p><a href=#>What is Post Malone‚Äôs net worth?

The two reportedly met at work sometime in 2015 and for Malone, it was love at first sight. They dated but kept their relationship quiet. Even though they posted photos together on social media, they were very infrequent. Despite the on-again off-again nature of their relationship, many people believed that they will eventually end up getting married to each other.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>happy Texas time birthday to most wonderful thing to ever happen to me Ashlen Nicole Diaz. üíñ I love u</p>‚Äî twelve carat toothache (@PostMalone) <a href=#>December 19, 2015</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in 2018, the couple decided to call it quits. Although no official reason for the breakup was disclosed, many suspected that Malone's hectic schedule was to blame. He had admitted to struggling with work-life balance in an interview on The Breakfast Club in 2016, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough having a balance between dedicating my life to music and dedicating time for Ashlen. It‚Äôs tough because you want to get into the studio, you want to do as good music as you can, sometimes you‚Äôre real busy.‚Äù</p><p>After his breakup with Ashlen, Malone has been linked to a Korean singer and visual artist MLMA (which translates for Me Love Me A Lot). In 2020, MLMA uploaded images of herself with the rapper on Instagram ‚Äî the pictures have since been deleted. MLMA is a successful streetwear designer, singer, and online influencer who was born in Seoul. She, just like Malone, is a creative person who enjoys expressing herself via her art.</p><p>She once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Vogue</a>, ‚ÄúGrowing up, I was super lonely and [art] became a way of entertaining myself. Since then, I‚Äôve always been into creating something, whether it‚Äôs with computers, paint, pencils, or clay. I thought it was a great way to make as many people as uncomfortable as possible. I feel nowadays, no one pays much attention to real art, they skim by it in their feeds. But when you scroll by one of my videos, it‚Äôs difficult to look away.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>We can't be sure if Malone's baby mama is MLMA given how discreet he is about his personal life. However, according to some insiders who spoke to TMZ, the rapper had a party in Southern California this past weekend in celebration of the new family member.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKmmrKxdoq6tu82eqmarlZi%2FpsCMoKCrpJantqa6w2apmqigmr9usdepnJysmaO0brLIq6qtZZOdtq2w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
