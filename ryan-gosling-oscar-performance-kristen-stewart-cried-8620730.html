Although Stewart wasn't the biggest Barbie kid growing up (she played with more "Weird Barbie"-like toys), she became "obsessed" with the Barbie movie. In fact, she even cried during leading man <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryan Gosling's viral performance</a> at the Academy Awards.

Best they've been in years, I feel. Don't you think it was just a good show?" Stewart asked host Amanda Hirsch before revealing the true reason she enjoyed the awards show so much: Gosling's rendition of Mark Ronson's nominated song, "I'm Just Ken."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was, for some reason, crying and laughing&nbsp;while watching the Ken thing," she said.

Much to the delight of Twihards everywhere, the actress said if she were to have a traditional wedding, she would definitely pick out a dress similar to that of her character <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella's now-famous Carolina Herrera&nbsp;gown</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love that dress so much,” she said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WhoWhatWear</a>. “I remember getting into it. It felt like getting into a real wedding dress because I was being hidden in some room with, like, heaters, and I was like, ‘It’s too hot in here, and my makeup’s melting off.’ And they’re like, ‘Well, we’re not going to be ready for another 30 minutes.’ It was like, ‘But I’m ready now. This is the time that I can play the bride.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "Yeah, I think if I were to ever do like a classic wedding dress, this is kind of the one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570bKYp2WXpMCttc2gZKirk5a%2FbrzEq52oqp2Wu6SxjKSpoqukmrtuv9OerpqqpGKws7XEnWRxbmJlhHR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
