Romanski: Things we heard about? Uh, more like experienced.

Yeah – a lot of these things came from our own personal experiences, and stuff that we read online."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Uh, more like experienced. [Laughs] Let’s just say the line “First one done!” from the&nbsp;pilot, well, that came&nbsp;from a friend of mine, and let’s just say his name was…Womanski? Yeah – a lot of these things came from our own personal experiences, and stuff that we read online. Some of this stuff is stories our friends had. The craziest things, where people are like, “How did you guys come up with that?” – for example, the girl with no arms? Real story. Came from Eric’s hometown.<strong><br></strong></p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false><strong>Eric Falconer</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We had our little bar in Massachusetts, and this girl would hang out. She was cool as shit, she was great, and just happened to have no arms. We’d hang out, and she was an amazing person. I loved that as a character, so she was incorporated into the series.</p><p data-characters=881 data-current-count=1160 data-injectable=true>Also, in the pilot, the chocolate cookie race – I never had to do it, but it basically came from my want to play high school football. I was in eighth grade, and wanted to try out, but heard all of these horrible hazing stories. The one that stuck out most was the Oreo cookie race. All the freshmen would have to race that way, and then eat the cookie out of their asses. I was so petrified, and right before I tried out, there was a huge hazing scandal at my school where a kid was hung from a tree and hit with broomsticks, I think? There was a lot of crazy stuff going on, and the town&nbsp;came down really hard on the football team. When I got there, a couple months later, there was zero hazing. I never had to go through any of it, but I still remember that feeling of being 13 years old, and thinking, “I want to play football, but I’m scared as Hell!”</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;I have to ask – was the cookie race actually filmed, or just Hollywood magic?</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>: What’s funny is that I still remember Brian Robbins, who directed the pilot. We were shooting that scene, and I’m like, “Where are the cookies?” He’s like, “Guys, you don’t really have to run with cookies up your ass.” I’m like, “No! That’s going to change the way you move entirely!”</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false><strong>Romanski</strong>: Everyone had their own running style, basically.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He’s like, “You don’t have to do this!” and we’re like, “Nope, we’re putting them way up there.”</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false><strong>Romanski</strong>: Well, actually, YOU said that. [To Alan] WE didn’t put them WAY up there. Let’s just say we lost about a half a row of cookies in Thad…</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You know the feeling you get when you eat a bunch of Oreos, and you get that slick trans-fatty feeling on the roof of your mouth? I was wiping that feeling for about a week. But that scene changed everything!</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false><strong>Eric Falconer</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I almost threw up on set. I was with Brian, saying, “Why are you putting cookies up your ass for real? No one’s going to see it, you don’t have to!” I talked to each actor, separately, and they said the same thing – “I need to know how to run.”</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>: I mean, that pales in comparison to eating actual goat balls. You guys made me eat goat balls against my will!</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false><strong>Romanski</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We did some amazing things. I got an opportunity to zip-line naked, while jerking off. My parents were there for that scene. It was a dream. To zip-line&nbsp;across a football field naked is insane!</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false><strong>Eric Falconer</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I actually have cellphone footage from directly under the zip-line, and it’s horrifying. You never want to see it.</p><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>WGTC:&nbsp;So this leads into my next question perfectly…</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false><strong>Romanski</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Where can you get that link? [Laughs]</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;Well, I was going to ask that after the recorder was off, so let’s go ahead and recap your most memorable day of filming on the set of Blue Mountain State. What was your highlight reel moment?</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true><strong>Romanski</strong>: We’ve been answering a lot of these questions – like we just did an AMA yesterday, and each time, a new thing pops up. Right now, it’s coming through the mud in the episode “Drunk Tank.” That was so fucking fun. They built this platform, we brought in rain – we did this iconic thing.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>: We were really pushing ourselves through that much mud.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false><strong>Romanski</strong>: It was so much fun, and it was even FREEZING that day. Every character got to do it, and like the cookie, everyone came through in a different way. Compared to everyone else, I’m so small and frail – them pulling me up through mud just looked absolutely insane.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true><strong>Alan Ritchson</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>One scene that never made it into the show – I actually haven’t thought of this in years – but one scene during “Vision Quest,” when we come back to reality at the end, we realize Thad’s been in this crazy hallucination, and he’s destroyed the Goat&nbsp;House. Well, basically, they turned the cameras on and were like, “Just destroy the Goat House,” and I DE-STROYED the entire place. That was one of the funnest moments to shoot. It never made the episode, though…</p><p data-characters=807 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=false><strong>Eric Falconer</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, we just cut to Thad sitting in the mess. But for me, I’ll say this – there were a lot of crazy scenes that were fun to shoot. We got to do so much stuff on Spike. But the first day of shooting for Blue Mountain State: The Rise Of Thadland, there are two scenes that stand out. One involves Sammy and a goat, and there’s another that involves Thad in the “Lube Room.” That first day of filming, shooting those two scenes, that, to me, topped shooting the series. In the show, we shot every day, and we’d try to top ourselves – but this was the first day on the film. We’re with a whole new crew, some actors&nbsp;hadn’t seen each other in years, and the first thing we shoot are a bestiality scene, then a “Lube Room” scene.</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>3</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>4</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGbnKrAqsLEZqCnrJWnw6qx1marmqSbnruoecGlrJ5lnaTCr8DAoqVmq6SWwaZ5wKWYp2WinsGktNKopWadop6wbrLApZqoppWneqS00aKqZqqfoq6vv8qiZKunnZa7sHuSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
