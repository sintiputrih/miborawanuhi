A herd of wild elephants trampled a suspected poacher to death and seriously injured another in a south Indian forest near the Thattekad bird sanctuary on January 4.
The two suspected poachers were part of a four-member gang that had entered the restricted forest to hunt illegally, forest officials told The Indian Express."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was later admitted to a private hospital in Aluva, a nearby town, where doctors reported his medical condition as serious.</p><p>The remaining members of the gang — named Sajith and Anish — then informed friends and relatives about what had happened, and word eventually got to forest officials.</p><p>Sajith and Anish then secretly left town in a hurry, officials say. However, police have registered a case against the men under India’s <a href=#>Wildlife Protection Act, 1972</a>. Police were also able to recover the weapons and other hunting equipment from the scene of the crime.</p><p>While these men may have been thwarted, poaching of course remains a serious problem.</p><p>Recent reports have shown, for example, that poaching is causing an increasing number of African elephants to be <a href=#>born without tusks</a>.</p><p>Because poachers only kill elephants with tusks, a population “ends up with a higher proportion of tuskless animals who then reproduce and tend to produce tuskless offspring,” according to Joyce Poole of Elephant Voices. “In this day and age, with all the poaching going on, tuskless elephants are at an advantage because they are not being targeted for their tusks.”</p><p>Thus, some now fear that African elephants will end up like their Asian cousins, who are now virtually tuskless.</p><p>Still, as the Asian elephants near Thattekad showed the poachers earlier this month, tusks are not what gives an elephant teeth.</p><p>Next, read the inside about the (mostly) legal practice of <a href=#>hunting endangered species in Africa</a>, before checking out the <a href=#>infamous lion killer who recently fell 100 feet to his death during a huntr</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonymuMSpn5qmpKh6tb7ApqelnV2lvKKvx56p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
