His fierce temper, zero intolerance for "perps," and cozy relationship with his NYPD partner, Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), kept the audience riveted. Meloni played Stabler to the hilt for 12 years until 2011, when <a href=#>he exited the show reportedly due to a contract dispute</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Have Law And Order’s Mariska Hargitay And Christopher Meloni Ever Dated?</a></span></p><p>He eventually returned to the Law & Order franchise in 2021 as the star of a new NBC spin-off, Law & Order: Organized Crime. He has also appeared on SVU in occasional crossover episodes.</p><p>It seemed like little had changed. Stabler was still tough and relentless in his pursuit of criminals. But one thing sure had improved a lot for Meloni as far as his bank account was concerned. His net worth apparently skyrocketed to $30 million after he left SVU. Here's what made Chris Meloni's net worth so enormous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-the-39-law-amp-order-svu-39-cast-paid><strong>How Much Is The 'Law & Order: SVU' Cast Paid?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mariska-hargitay-and-christopher-meloni-reunite-today-main-190916-001.jpg><p>Even through SVU has been in the air since 1999, its iconic "ripped from the headlines" formula, plus consistently solid performances, writing, and direction, have kept it going strong with viewers year after year. A talented cast of likable stars kept them tuning in, too.</p><p>According to published reports, Hargitay, Ice-T, who plays Detective (now Sergeant) Odafin "Fin" Tutuola, and Meloni, when he was a regular, are/were very well-compensated.</p><p>Hargitay evidently merits what she brings home for each episode of SVU. Olivia Benson has been the heartbeat of the show since it began. Audiences have seen various facets of her career and personality throughout its run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Law & Order: SVU Has Been Sued Multiple Times, Here's The Truth About Each Scandal</a></span></p><p>Benson has been an intrepid law enforcement professional, a team leader, a mom, a girlfriend, a sister, and a passionate advocate for victims of heinous sexual crimes. It's not surprising, then, that <a href=#>Hargitay reportedly earns a hefty $500,000 for each installment of SVU</a>.</p><p>Ice-T's salary is pretty substantial as well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He apparently rakes in $260,000 per episode</a>, per Parade. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meloni made even more money, a reported $395,000 per episode,</a> according to Nicki Swift. That would have amounted to an impressive $10 million per season.</p><h2 id=chris-meloni-left-39-law-amp-order-svu-39-over-contract-negotiations><strong>Chris Meloni Left 'Law & Order SVU' Over Contract Negotiations</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kelli-giddish-law-order_-svu-with-marishka-hargitay-benson-and-christopher-meloni.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Meloni left SVU, devotees of the show were puzzled as to precisely what happened. <a href=#>D</a>etails were sketchy and vague. <a href=#>The inexact phrase "contract disputes" was given as the reason</a> for his departure. In addition, Meloni's attitude about his castmates' reaction appeared to some observers to be kind of cavalier.</p><p>In 2021, Meloni chose to explain a bit about what happened behind closed doors that led to him quitting the role that made him so famous. He told Men's Health that when he and the execs at NBC clearly did not see eye-to-eye on how much money he should get to come back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meloni said that he suggested a contract compromise</a>.</p><p>"My thought was: Instead of 22 episodes, bring me back for nine episodes, or bring me back for 18 episodes. They literally came to me on a Thursday night and said, ‘This is the deal. We want the answer by tomorrow. It’s our way or no way'."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meloni's account of that response from his bosses certainly hints that it did not sit too well with him. He said he opted to be cut loose from the show. "This is what I want. If you can’t do it, that’s fine. Let’s figure out my exit.”</p><h2 id=chris-meloni-39-s-net-worth-is-30-million-today><strong>Chris Meloni's Net Worth Is $30 Million Today</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mariska-hargitay-chris-meloni-law-and-order-svu-romance-tease.jpg><p>After his Law & Order days seemed to be over, Meloni didn't spend his time moping. He took acting roles in films such as Man of Steel (2013), White Bird in a Blizzard (2014), and Almost Friends (2016). His television appearances included True Blood (2012), Comedy Bang! Bang! (2013), and Wet Hot American Summer: TenYears Later (2017).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <strong><a href=#>Did Kelli Giddish Want Her Law & Order: SVU Exit To Be Drastically Different?</a></strong></span></p><p>But Elliot Stabler clearly remained in Meloni's blood. When Dick Wolf, the Law & Order franchise producer, approached him in February 2020 about coming back in a show of his own as Stabler, who would be on the hunt for the Mafia bad guys who killed his beloved wife, Kathy, the idea resonated favorably with Meloni (per Men's Health). The time was right and he was ready.</p><p>He also allegedly got a nice big salary to boot. Meloni and Hargitay may be pals on- and off-screen, but as reported by Radar Online, they were vying with each other about the pay and perks they got.</p><p>Said an unnamed source, "Obviously they had to offer him [for Law & Order: Organized Crime] equal to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Mariska earns [on SVU]— which translates to roughly $540k</a> an episode."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meloni has come roaring back richer, sexier, and brasher than ever, to the delight of his fans. He even graced the cover of People in October 2022 with the sassy headline, "Love, Aging & Looking Great Naked!" His nonchalant attitude of not taking himself too seriously while loving what he does should maintain his status as a fan favorite for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGwvMeeqWallaG8r7XSZqWerF2svLPAx2ahrqWgmrFuu82cnGaglWK5prLTZqOar12kv6Wx0Waqr61f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
