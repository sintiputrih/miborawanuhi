John was interviewed later on during the show and talked about his past accolades with the company, like winning Tough Enough and the Intercontinental title.</p><p>When asked what's changed with him as a performer in the years he's been away, Morrison jokingly replied, "I don't know how this is possible ... but 8 years, while Miz was working at World Wrestling Entertainment, somehow, I feel like I still wrestled more than him."&nbsp;</p><p>John then name dropped Lucha Underground, Impact, AAA and 5 Star Wrestling in the UK as promotions where he became champion during his time away from WWE. Surprisingly, photos were shown of John competing in Lucha Underground and Impact during the segment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I left in 2011, I meant to take a year off," Morrison explained. "I wanted to make some movies and do my own thing for a little bit. That year turned into 8 years. It's crazy how fast the time flew. And part of it was because I was having a lot of fun wrestling for all these other places."</p><p>Adding, "Every time you wrestle for another place you sign a contract, and then they want to have you sign for longer and extend and extend. And I felt like I was really a big part of all these organizations – Lucha Underground, Impact, 5 Star Wrestling – I was, like, the guy. The brand ambassador. It was cool having all that autonomy."</p><p>Morrison ultimately realized, however, that he needed to return to WWE before more time passed.</p><p>Watch the full interview below, which also includes a video cameo from "The Miz."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnmqS1r3nMqKmroaOku261za2cq66ZmsRuw9aeZJutnaV6t7XDnqZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
