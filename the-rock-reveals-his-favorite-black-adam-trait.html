He doesn’t have any qualms about doing what he feels needs to be done, which doesn’t exactly sit well with the heroes. This was also a change of pace for Johnson, who’s accustomed to playing good guys — and even his characters who’re on the rougher side still usually have a heart of gold.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>The actor said that he’s never played a character who’s as present in every moment and in every scene and that there’s a real intensity to him. In most cases with heroes — and sometimes even villains — there’s an internal struggle the character has in deciding what action to take. Black Adam will be more decisive about knowing what he wants and how best to get it.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Black Adam doesn’t pull its punches and there even was an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">R-rated version of Black Adam</a> at one point, unlike the theatrical release which will be PG-13, and it reportedly required a lot of cuts to get it there. This has inspired some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans to request the more mature version of Black Adam</a>, and if it gains enough momentum, (and with Johnson so eager to please the fans) it could be released to the public.</p><p data-characters=33 data-current-count=33 data-injectable=false>Black Adam hits theaters Oct. 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGaqn5i4br7Er5yapKNitaq%2FjJ%2BYr6einsGmecGlmJyjXZaxormMramaoaRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
