Post-graduation, she moved to New York City and Andy followed her there in 1988. He supported her career as a designer and in 1993, he helped her launch her own line of accessories using her first name and his last name. While they weren't married at the time, they did tie the knot in 1994 and were together up until her death by suicide on June 5, 2018. However, it is believed that they had quietly separated a few months before that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Kate may no longer be with us, fans are still putting together the pieces of her and David's connection.</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a>, some users are falsely claiming that David and Kate were siblings or were married.
