I already got a silly shield if she is on my tribe, because she seems even more rambunctious and friendly.

He’s got two earrings and a little bit of a Jerry Seinfeld mullet. He is rocking it better than me, honestly, and I can’t get a read on him, but he just seems really focused, and going back to what I said about having an ally who is concentrated and doesn’t self-sabotage, I feel like that guy might be it. I just have to get a read to know for sure. Honestly, that’s what’s so hard.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>While she might not have been drawn to him right off the bat, could Liz and Ben be a match made in heaven when it comes to allyship on Survivor 46?
