For the most recent year of available data (2002), the stroke death rate for black men was 82 per 100,000, whereas the rate for white men was 54 per 100,000. Similarly, the death rate from stroke is higher in black women (72 per 100,000) than it is in white women (53 per 100,000).</p><p>According to George Howard, Dr. P.H., chair of the department of biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, black men and women are disproportionately affected by stroke risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension.

They hypothesized that secondary preventative interventions like daily aspirin and lifestyle improvements including weight loss, exercise, and smoking cessation contributed to the early survival benefit.</p><h3>They argued that People Were Less Likely to Take Precautions Against Stroke as Time Passed.</h3><p>Age, diabetes, and previous vascular disease were all factors in determining mortality and cardiovascular events in the Dutch study. Adjusted for age and gender, the hazard ratios for having diabetes, claudication, prior peripheral vascular surgery, and pathological Q waves on a baseline ECG were as follows: 2.10 (1.79-2.48), 1.77 (1.45-2.15), 1.94 (1.42-2.65), and 1.50 (1.31-1.71).</p><p>Patients with transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke should be repeatedly reassessed (because risks can change), treated to prevent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, and treated long-term, wrote Graeme<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> J.
