Of course, the most prominent visual cue is her new haircut, which Maggie Siff was eager to do. But it was only to help accentuate how the show’s moral compass was now chaotically spinning in the shadows. At this point in Season 6, Tara is cruelly peppered with horrible catastrophes like attempted kidnappings, assassination plots, a stint in prison, and dashed medical dreams. It’s all enough to make any character develop some edge. But despite all that happens to Tara, Siff noted to Collider in 2013 that the character seems to have an endless supply of inner strength.</p><p dir=ltr>“The thing that surprises me in playing her and in figuring out how to play her are really her reserves of strength and power,” Siff said. “Even as her mind is warping and things in her psyche are shifting, in a way that I think is really negative, and things are breaking, there’s also a fierceness in her that rises up, perpetually. That’s the surprise.” Perhaps Tara’s fierceness comes from her love for her family. It can be argued that many of Tara’s decisions, although sometimes terrible, have been rooted in looking out for Jax and their children. On the other hand, Tara is also a character whose back has been against the wall many times. Her final actions in Season 6 show her finding the strength to make one last-ditch effort at a safer life. It’s just too bad her plans don’t work out in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cL%2FOp6pmp5Zirq%2Bt0ZyfsmWjqa6zecyanqChlWLAqrLFZq6aq12WuqLGxJ1km7Fdqa6zrdJmp56qoJrBtq3LZp2inaKYsq%2Bx0qxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
