The office wrote that a woman, ‚Äútentatively identified as Frentorish ‚ÄòTori‚Äô Bowie (DOB: 8/27/1990), was found dead in the home.

An autopsy shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times </a>stated that, tragically, Tori was eight months pregnant and in labor at the time of her death. The autopsy listed respiratory distress and eclampsia as possible complications.</p><p>A program at Tori's funeral stated that she had been preceded in death by a daughter, Ariana Bowie.</p><p>Tori was born and raised in Mississippi, where she rose up as a track star after playing basketball. After high school, she took over the long jump NCAA championships while attending Southern Mississippi and later competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics. There, she won the silver medal for the 100-meter dash and the bronze for the 200-meter dash. She also helped lead the USA team to a gold medal victory in the 4x100 relay.</p><p>After Tori‚Äôs impressive performance in Rio, her hometown of Sandhill, Miss., dubbed Nov. 25 ‚ÄúTori Bowie Day.‚Äù She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hattiesburg American</a>, "I've never even thought about anything like this. It's like back in Sandhill, they have a sign right when you turn inside [the campus at Pisgah High, her alma mater], they actually have a sign, it says 'Tori Bowie Lane.' To see things like that and like this, it's just like miracles, I guess."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tori Bowie (@1toribowie)</a></p></figure><p>At the time, she said her goal was to focus on her training, but she also hired a publicist and wanted to dive (or shall we say sprint) into more acting and modeling.
