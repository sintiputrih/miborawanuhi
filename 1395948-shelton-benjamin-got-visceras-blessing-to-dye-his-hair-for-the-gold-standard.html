But at a time, I tasted single success to me going back into the tag team stepped backwards. And so, I was thinking, okay, what can I change about myself? What can I add to make myself that basically changed up made myself more interesting and more marketable?</p><p>“But I didn’t want to do anything so drastic that if I didn’t like it, I couldn’t kind of morph back. I thought about dyeing my hair blonde, but I always held off. Because, at the time, Viscera still had the blonde Mohawk, you know, so for me, that would be encroaching on his gimmick.</p><h2 id=h-ask-for-forgiveness-instead-of-permission>Ask For Forgiveness Instead Of Permission</h2><p>“So when he became Big Daddy V, and you know, at this time now&nbsp; I’m in a tag team, and I went to him, I said, Hey, I think I dye my hair blonde, do you mind? He was like; I don’t care. I’m not doing blonde anymore, like knock it knock yourself out.</p><p>“So because I had his blessing, I was like, Okay, and what finally, what finally made me pull the trigger on it. I don’t even think he knows this, but Stone Cold had addressed the talent, you know, talking about, you know, come out of your shell, working hard to be a star, like taking risks and all these things.</p><p>“And it was that day like, I’m listening to Stone Cold, and I’m going I think there was a hint of asking for forgiveness, not permission. That day, I was like, I walked out of the meeting, I went to one of the girls, that’s hair like, Hey, would you bleach my hair for me? And I bleached it.”</p><p><a href=#>Shelton Benjamin: There’s No Way I’d Use My Real Mother For ‘Momma Benjamin’ Storyline</a></p><p>What do you make of Shelton Benjamin’s comments?
