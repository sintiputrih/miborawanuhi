Tammy Slaton, a 1000-lb Sisters star, has a new man in her life. Just a few weeks after it was claimed online that the reality star had broken up with her husband, Caleb Willingham, the reality star is apparently dating a 25-year-old.</p><p>First reported by The Sun the outlet claimed that Tammy connected with Indiana-based Greg Morgan AKA Allan Umphrey using a dating app. They “immediately hit it off,” according to a source, and have been “seeing each other for about a month now” after meeting each other on the dating app.</p><p>‘He’s come to see her a handful of times. He takes a six-hour bus from Indianapolis to visit her in&nbsp;<span data-track-module=internal-body-link><a id=mol-fb26ef10-f0d0-11ed-b9ef-cb497bc26d69 href=# rel=noopener>Kentucky</a></span>,’ the outlet revealed. According to the insider, Greg has even interacted with Amy Slaton’s sister and her nephews, Gage and Glenn. ‘Tammy is shy around him and didn’t want to eat in front of him. She said she finds him very attractive,’ the source revealed to the outlet.</p><p>Another source opened up about Tammy’s new romance and added that “They’ve been talking regularly and they seem to really like each other, but they are trying to figure out when he’ll visit again because things get tough around her filming schedule.” Tammy previously wed Caleb, whom she met while receiving treatment. In the treatment facility parking lot in October 2022, he proposed to the TV personality. The two later married in a quiet ceremony seen by their loved ones two months later.</p><p>“They have a lot of the same struggles that they can share. They’ve been a huge support for each other [in rehab], which is awesome,” an insider revealed at the time. However, it was revealed earlier this month that they had broken up after just five months of marriage. Insiders told the&nbsp;<a class=class href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Sun&nbsp;</a>at the time that the breakup came after he ‘refused to stick to his diet.’</p><p>The insider added, “He has gained 30 lbs and hasn’t been working his program. They got into a big fight over it and he told her he wanted a divorce, but then he tried to backtrack. Tammy’s sisters Amy and Amanda were already encouraging her to just move on. She wants someone who can be there for her and his health keeps declining.”</p><p>They added further, “She would have to take care of him once he’s out of rehab, and that is her taking on the care of a whole other person when she can barely take care of herself, so the relationship is pointless.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The source also pointed out that they “got married after just knowing each other over the course of weeks,” adding, “She isn’t able to care for someone else at this point in her recovery.” It was said that they signed a prenup before tying the knot – so her earnings from the reality show were protected.</p><p>After the news went public, Greg took to his TikTok and posted snapshots of outlets claiming that the two are dating. He captioned the <a href=#>TikTok post</a>, “<span class="tiktok-j2a19r-SpanText efbd9f0">This is really irritating like people just can’t be friends this is crazy </span>@Tammy Slaton.”</p><p>In another video that he recently posted, Greg replied to a comment that read, “It’s gotta be for the money.” He made the <a href=#>TikTok</a> replying, “This type of sh-t makes my as* itch. Go find something to do.” So, in a way, Greg denied the relationship.</p><p>But, Greg revealed on his Facebook that he is in a relationship. Additionally, he is a dad to his daughter named Sekani Denise Umphrey. On 3 March 2022, on her birthday, she wrote, “With everything that’s going on today I still have to make it a point to wish my youngest daughter Aaliyah￼￼￼ Sekani Denise Umphrey ￼Walker happy birthday that’s my twin if y’all can’t see.”</p><p>His older daughter turned 5 years old in December 2022.</p><p>Greg had his daughter with his girlfriend <a href=#>Qaween Erykah</a>. On Mother’s Day 2022, he wished his baby mother, “Happy Mother’s Day to my fucking headache but she is the best mother I could ask for for my daughter Happy Mother’s Day to you big head &nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv x1qq9wsj xo1l8bm" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=xt0psk2>Qaween Erykah</span></a>.”</p><h3>Greg Morgan Age</h3><p>According to The Sun, as of 2023, Greg Morgan is 25 years old.</p><h3>Greg Morgan Job</h3><p>Greg Morgan is a rap producer by trade.
