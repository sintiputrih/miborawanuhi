So, that’s a that’s a&nbsp;good message&nbsp;for today,” he added.</p><p>Profiles for each adoptable puppy and the shelter they come from will be on puppybowl.com/adopt.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Puppy Bowl referee Dan Schachner said that the event reaches 100% adoption rate every year while on air. <span class=credit>ANIMAL PLANET</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Profiles for each adoptable puppy and the shelter they come from will be on puppybowl.com/adopt. <span class=credit>ANIMAL PLANET</span></figure><p>Schachner has been a referee for the Puppy Bowl for 12 years and he’s seen puppy participants get adopted on set during and after the game. Viewers also&nbsp;call in to request certain dogs&nbsp;that have captured their attention.</p><p>“It happens literally before our eyes,” Schachner said.</p><p>On the Puppy Bowl field, refereeing energetic puppies can apparently be a challenge even with Schachner’s dozen years of experience.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">“It’s going to be puppies being as wild and crazy and lovable as you would imagine they would be,” said referee Dan Schachner.&nbsp; <span class=credit>ANIMAL PLANET</span></figure><p>“In puppy football, it’s new players, new rosters, new faces every single year,” Schachner explained, adding that the pups must be between three and six months of age. “They [also] have to be up for adoption, and they have to be&nbsp;<a href=#>untrained puppies</a>.&nbsp;So, it’s going to be puppies being as wild and crazy and lovable as you would imagine they would be.”&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, “You’re seeing them in their true element. They’re going to do all the things that puppies do.”</p><p>Schachner said that over the years, he’s gotten better at reading the field and what goes on around him while the program has grown.</p><p>Schachner is also aided by about 20 different camera angles that capture all the action.</p><p>“I can always go to the videotape if I need some extra help,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>New additions to <a href=#>the Puppy Bowl </a>include a partnership with the dog DNA company Wisdom Panel, which has helped organizers create a “scouting report” based on breed traits, and celebrity kitten guests who can’t yet be announced but will be a “special surprise,” according to Schachner.</p><p>“In the pre-game show we’ll learn the scouting reports for these dogs we know we’ll get. I’ll be giving some predictions prior to the game who to look out for,” Schachner said.</p><p>The game will last three hours and will include the Kitty Halftime Show, plus the red carpet event, according to Schachner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmamlfpcKxvNhmmaivnGK%2FpsDUq6WsZZakv259mK2fZrGVlr9uu81mqq6olad6o7vWpWRraGJoeri0wK1kraddoLuww44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
