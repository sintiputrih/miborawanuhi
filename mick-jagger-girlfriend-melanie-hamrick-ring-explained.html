Speaking with <strong></strong> magazine in June 2023, she elaborated on the gift, referring to it now as a "promise" ring. "I mean, I have to giggle because did Mick give me the ring? Yes. Is it for that finger? Yes," she said, but she later admitted marriage wasn't currently on the cards for the couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/41b90928eae2-mick-jagger-melanie-hamrick-ring.jpg><p id=evGpWY1ZzKL data-wc=74>"I'm kind of like, a live-in-the-moment type of person, so who knows," she said. Still, much can be said for the singer's special gift. "Melanie's ring is an art deco engagement ring. Popular between the 1920s and 1930s across the arts and architecture, art deco is a specific aesthetic that showcases a novel sense of self and rebellious spirit," said Maxwell Stone, the Leading Diamond Expert at engagement ring and diamond experts <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Steven Stone</a></strong>.</p><p id=ee2OQ66sOhA data-wc=72>Revealing that the ring is an antique, Maxwell continued by saying looking at the accessory is "like going back in time, as it features an old cut diamond that's likely to have been cut before the 1930s." With its square shape and rounded corners, "old cut diamonds epitomize the enduring romance of gifting diamonds –&nbsp;making it an incredibly romantic choice from Mick," the expert finished, before valuing the piece at $100,000.</p><p id=en41BUjM0D data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Mick Jagger and ex-wife Jerry Hall reunite in rare family photo</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e85779acb377-mick-jagger-melanie-hamrick-family-1.jpg><p id=e5BT0xnHTFjS data-wc=58>As previously mentioned, Melanie and Mick have been together since 2014 after they met on a tour of Tokyo, Japan.
