She made a name for herself in the '80s and even now in 2020, people still love her so much! Madonna is definitely an incredible singer with all of the adoring fans to prove it.</p><h2 id=adele><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Adele</span></h2><p><a href=#>Adele</a> looks up to Madonna. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DrownedMadonna.com</a>, Adele said, "There’s a reason there’s only one Madonna.&nbsp;For me, she’s the complete definition of evolving and evolving, and evolving each time.” She also revealed that her own album in 2018 was inspired by Madonna's Ray of Light album.</p><h2 id=avril-lavigne><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Avril Lavigne</span></h2><p>Back in 2011 when <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a> was 26 years old, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>, "I definitely can see myself still being out there in 20 years' time. I want to be around the way Madonna has done it. She's had her life but still maintained her career throughout." Avril Lavigne was huge in the early 2000s and a big reason why she got so big is that she looked to Madonna for inspiration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dua-lipa><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dua Lipa</span></h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy.com,</a> Dua Lipa talked about her song collab with Madonna saying, “It was very much a manifestation thing. I was thinking out loud. I was just talking with my manager and I was like, ‘You know who would sound really good on this? Madonna.'”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dua Lipa Reveals Her Experience With Sexism In The Music Industry</a></span></p><p>She went on to say, “And he said, ‘You know, we could try. We could send it to her and see if she likes it. She responded and she was so down. I was over the moon. I couldn’t believe that she wanted to do this record with me. I’m such a fan. It was really exciting.”</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gwen Stefani</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke on Madonna saying</a>, "It's weird that we have all these similarities. Madonna's had us over to dinner and stuff. She's always been very nice to me... A lot of my influence came from her early work, like directly, like a Xerox." Gwen Stefani is a great singer and it makes her so much better to learn that she finds Madonna to be an inspiring musician to follow after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hilary Duff</span></h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a>, Hilary Duff talked about her childhood with older sister Haylie Duff. She said, "We grew up rocking out to Madonna when we were younger. We would make up dances when we were little kids to her music. We feel honored to get to do this." By "this" she was referring to the fact that she and her sister were covering Madonna's hit song "Material Girls" for the 2006 movie of the same name they were starring in.</p><h2 id=iggy-azalea><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Iggy Azalea</span></h2><p><a href=#>Iggy Azalea</a> opened up about how inspired by Madonna she is when she said, "One tour I really love that I didn't go to, unfortunately, was the Madonna Confessions tour. I love that tour so much. It was actually why I called up Jamie King, who's working on the tour with me--because he left Madonna's tour. I was like, 'I've gotta have the people that were involved in creating this.' I love when the stage changes and transforms." (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>.) They might perform different genres, but Madonna still inspired Iggy Azalea quite a bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-clarkson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kelly Clarkson</span></h2><p><a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> is another major musician who has found great inspiration from Madonna's musical career. Kelly Clarkson won the first-ever season of American Idol, a show focused on finding raw and pure singing talent. Kelly Clarkson has since covered several Madonna songs at various performances on various stages as a way of showing respect and homage to Madonna.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> spoke up&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about Madonna in an interview</a> saying, "I hope when I'm her age I'm next to the young up and comer doing whatever it is. I want to always embrace new artists and as I get older I want to continue to evolve with the artists. And that's what I think was so cool about Madonna doing that, not looking at me as someone who just looks at her and tries... 'cause I'm not trying to replicate her or be her, we're standing for similar freedom". She is already, in 2020, currently emulating Madonna's 80s vibes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-minaj><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nicki Minaj</span></h2><p><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> appreciates both Madonna and Marilyn Monroe. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>, "When I walked on set and saw Madonna, I literally gasped because I felt like I was looking at Marilyn Monroe and I’m so obsessed with Marilyn Monroe…"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Nicki Minaj Releases New Music Video But Her Fans Are Slow To Show Love</a></span></p><p>She continued saying, "When I saw Madonna, she really to me was Marilyn Monroe and it was very surreal because it’s like, I almost felt like I was doing a video with my two idols at the same time. It was like, very very strange." That must have been such an exciting experience for Nicki Minaj.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, Taylor Swift said, “One element of Madonna’s career that really takes center stage is how many times she’s reinvented herself. It’s easier to stay in one look, one comfort zone, one musical style. It’s inspiring to see someone whose only predictable quality is being unpredictable.” Taylor Swift has reinvented herself a few times so far, just like Madonna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Think Madonna's Punk Rock Throwback Hints At The Sounds On Her Upcoming Album</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJmrqGnXZi2tbGMppidp56jrm6t0maroZ2Zp3qqutKpoKuZpJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
