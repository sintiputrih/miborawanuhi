The former couple apparently agreed to move to Sophie’s home country before they broke up. In response to the Game of Thrones star’s September 21 filing, a rep for Joe told <b>HollywoodLife</b> that the lawsuit was “misleading” and a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“serious abuse of the legal system at worst”</a> due to the “language” in the filing, such as its use of the word, “abduction.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_MsoNormal>Joe’s rep also said that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the exes</a> “had a cordial meeting” when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids. “They have been with her since that meeting,” said the rep. “<span class=outlook-search-highlight data-markjs=true>Joe</span>’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup.” The statement continued, “J<span class=outlook-search-highlight data-markjs=true>oe</span> is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the UK.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FrZqOnlWK3sLrArGSgnaSoerTBz6mmq6xdl7%2BwwMeeqaxlnp6wrHnKnq2ipl2bvLN50qKloKGenHq0u8%2BhoJ5lpKq%2Fr7HRZqOorpViwLC6xmaYrWWTpLuksdGtZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
