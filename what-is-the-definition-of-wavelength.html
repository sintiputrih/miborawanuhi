Metres (m) is the SI unit. Amplitude is the maximum distance covered by the particle from its mean position. The number of oscillations completed in unit time is known as frequency.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-wavelength-in-chemistry></span>What is wavelength in chemistry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Illustrated Glossary of Organic Chemistry – Wavelength ( λ ) Wavelength (λ): <b>In a wave the distance between any given point and the same point in the next wave cycle</b>. … Wavelength the distance between any given point and the same point in the next wave cycle.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-definition-of-wavelength-and-frequency></span>What is the definition of wavelength and frequency?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two corresponding points on adjacent waves</b>. … The frequency, represented by the Greek letter nu (ν), is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a specified amount of time. Typically, frequency is measured in units of cycles per second or waves per second.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-wavelength-of-indigo></span>What is the wavelength of indigo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The range of wavelength for indigo is <b>around 425–450 nm</b>.
